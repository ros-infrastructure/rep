Abstract
========

This REP defines the scope of the REP process defined in [1]_. It
provides a list of `REP Stacks`_ that are considered to be
within the scope of the REP process. It also defines the process of
including or removing stacks from this list.

Motivation
==========

At the time of this writing, there are over 1000 ROS packages
contributed by over 30 institutions. It would be onerous, encumbering
and unenforceable to apply the REP process to all existing ROS-based
software. Conversely, if we limit the scope of the REP process to ROS
itself, i.e. the packaging, build, and communication libraries, we
miss the opportunity to engage the community in designing
robot-specific capabilities.

In order to seek a balance between these two, we designate a list of
ROS stacks that are open to the REP process, and we provide a
lightweight mechanism by which new stacks can easily be added to this
list.

Specification
=============

REP Stacks
----------

We enumerate here the list of stacks considered to be within the scope
of the REP process.

ROS stacks:

- ros
- roslisp_support
- ros_comm
- ros_realtime
- ros_release
- rx

Base stacks:

- camera_drivers
- common
- common_msgs
- diagnostics
- driver_common
- geometry
- image_common
- image_pipeline
- image_transport_plugins
- imu_drivers
- joystick_drivers
- laser_drivers
- laser_pipeline
- navigation
- physics_ode
- point_cloud_perception
- robot_model
- simulator_gazebo
- simulator_stage
- slam_gmapping
- slam_karto
- sound_drivers
- vision_opencv
- visualization_common
- visualization


Third-party code
----------------

Many ROS stacks include externally developed, or third-party, code.
Enhancements to third-party code are out of the scope of a REP and
should be requested directly to the third-party developers.  REPs can
propose changes to the way that third-party code is integrated (e.g.,
updating the version of a third-party library that is pulled in).


Process for inclusion/removal
-----------------------------

Stacks may be added to or removed from the list above by sending an
email to ros-users@code.ros.org with "REP 2" in the Subject line. If
the voting process [2]_ shows clear favor the list can be quickly
updated. Otherwise, acceptance follows a similar process to those for
accepting PEPs [1]_. The Stack Maintainer has final veto power over
inclusion on this list.

Rationale
=========

"REP Stacks" vs. "Base"
-----------------------

The `REP Stacks`_ generally match those installed in the "base"
variant of the ROS turtle distributions (e.g. boxturtle-base,
cturtle-base). We do not use the name "base" here because we do not
wish to conflate the distribution of a stack with the process by which
a stack is reviewed. 

Stacks vs. packages
-------------------

We define this process at the stack level as that is the unit of
distribution for ROS software. Although a package-specific approach
would provide more fine-grained control over this process, ROS users
generally only interact with packages as a stack unit and thus
experience these libraries collectively.

Process for other stacks
------------------------

We do not define the process for stacks not included on this
list. Institutions and individuals are free to follow their own
development practices for the design and development of new
capabilities.

There are many reasons why the REP process may not be appropriate for
a library. For example, we encourage the release of code to accompany
research papers, and we do not wish to discourage this by placing
research code within the scope of the REP process.

Similarly, many of the current ROS libraries have gone through
multiple stages of prototyping and use to improve their design. Often,
the best way of understanding the design flaws of software is through
experimention and use, rather than e-mail dicussions.

As an example alternate process for REPs, Willow Garage follows an
internal review process that allows for multiple iterations of "API
review" followed by a "Documentation review". These reviews are
announced on the ros-review mailing list and are open to participants,
but they are not required to circulate REPs.
