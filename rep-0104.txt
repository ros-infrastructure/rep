Abstract
========

This REP adds support for binning and alternative distortion models to
``sensors_msgs/CameraInfo``.  It clarifies the correct interpretation
of region of interest (ROI), including how it interacts with binning
and distortion.

In this REP, ``sensor_msgs/CameraInfo`` acquires ``binning_x`` and
``binning_y`` fields.  The distortion parameter array ``D`` is made
variable-length, its meaning specified by a string.  This REP clarifies
ROI to mean the raw image region as captured by the camera and
introduces a distinction between raw ROI and rectified ROI.  It adds
appropriate new methods to the camera model classes in image_geometry_,
the recommended API for using ``CameraInfo``.

Motivation
==========

The ``CameraInfo`` message is used ubiquitously in ROS vision code and
commonly archived in bag files, so it is not to be changed lightly.
``CameraInfo`` is based on a well-established mathematical camera model
[#CameraInfo]_.  It already works well for by far the most common
use case, capturing full-resolution images from a camera with
less-than-extreme distortion.

Even so, experience from developing on top of ``CameraInfo`` in Box
Turtle and C Turtle has revealed several limitations of the current
message.  There is no support for binning, a common and useful camera
feature.  The distortion model has room for improvement when it comes
to wide angle or fisheye lenses with severe distortion.  The existing
ROI support in ``CameraInfo`` was not adequately thought out, limiting
its usefulness in practice.

It's debatable whether any of these issues individually merit a
breaking change to ``CameraInfo``.  This REP batches together fixes for
the major known problems with ``CameraInfo``, so that users need only
update code and bag files once.  We believe that together these
changes represent a significant improvement.  We expect the revised
``CameraInfo`` to remain stable for at least another 2-3 ROS
distributions.

Binning
-------

Binning is the process of summing small neighborhoods of pixels on chip
into larger "bins."  For example, 2x2 binning reduces the resolution of
the camera by half both horizontally and vertically.  The chief
advantage of binning is to increase the signal to noise ratio (SNR).
This is especially useful in low-light environments.  A second benefit
is that decimating the resolution may allow for increased frame rate.

Giving up resolution for increased SNR and/or frame rate is a useful
trade-off in many vision applications.  The utility of binning, combined
with its wide availability in camera hardware, makes this a particularly
valuable feature to support in ``CameraInfo``.

The correct geometric interpretation of a binned image requires scaling
the focal lengths and principal point calculated during calibration at
full resolution.  The current ``CameraInfo`` message unfortunately has no
way to encode the binning parameters.

Alternate Distortion Models
---------------------------

Currently ``CameraInfo`` assumes the "Plumb Bob" model of distortion
[#PlumbBob]_, a 5-parameter polynomial approximation of radial and
tangential distortion.  Recently OpenCV has added support for an
8-parameter rational polynomial distortion model.  This new model
offers improved stability and accuracy for wide angle and fisheye
lenses, which can severely distort the image.  Unfortunately the size
of the distortion parameter array ``D`` in ``CameraInfo`` is fixed at
5, so there is currently no way to support more complex models.

This REP makes ``D`` variable-length and introduces a string
``distortion_model`` to distinguish which distortion model was used in
the calibration.  These changes also accommodate adding other
distortion models in the future, should we find it necessary.

Region of Interest
------------------

Region of interest is another common camera feature, allowing the user
to instruct the imager to only capture a desired sub-rectangle of its
full resolution.  This may be used to reduce bandwidth, particularly
with high-definition cameras that could overwhelm a network connection
at full resolution.  Like binning, it may increase the frame rate for
some cameras.  Finally, it may improve the imagery of the object we
are interested in by applying smart camera features such as
auto-exposure only to the relevant image patch.

Applications of ROI to vision include performing high-speed tracking
of an object, or acquiring a high-resolution close-up of an object with
known location.

``CameraInfo`` already supports ROI in that it contains fields for the
sub-rectangle captured by the imager.  This ROI is given in raw image
coordinates, as supplied to the imager, as that is all the camera
driver is expected to know and care about.  Given the ROI and the
camera calibration, we (or rather image_geometry) can rectify the
image patch.  But what is the ROI of the rectified patch in rectified
coordinates; that is, given the full rectified image, what
sub-rectangle inside of it corresponds to the rectified patch?

Currently image_geometry (by extension, image_proc_) assumes that the
ROI in rectified coordinates is the same as the ROI in raw (unrectified)
coordinates.  This behavior is broken.  For small ROIs and/or large
amounts of distortion, the raw patch (once rectified) may not even
coincide with the same ROI in rectified coordinates.  In that case the
rectified image patch is set to all black, as the data required to fill
it was not even captured [#RoiTicket]_.  Therefore we must introduce a
mapping between the ROI in raw coordinates and the corresponding ROI in
rectified coordinates.

Specification
=============

CameraInfo Message
------------------

The proposed ``CameraInfo`` message is listed (stripped of comments)
below.  Additions and changes are noted on the right.

::

    Header header
      uint32 seq
      time stamp
      string frame_id

    uint32 height
    uint32 width

    # roi used to be located here.
    # I've moved it to after the calibration parameters.

    string distortion_model            # New field

    float64[] D                        # Made variable-length
    float64[9] K
    float64[9] R
    float64[12] P

    uint32 binning_x                   # New field
    uint32 binning_y                   # New field

    sensor_msgs/RegionOfInterest roi   # Moved field
      uint32 x_offset
      uint32 y_offset
      uint32 height
      uint32 width
      bool do_rectify                  # New field

Interpretation
--------------

There are three parts to ``CameraInfo``.

* ROS header.  The time stamp is the time at which the image was
  captured.  ``frame_id`` is the name of the optical coordinate frame
  with origin at the optical center of the camera.
* Calibration parameters.  These are fixed during camera calibration.
  Their values will be the same in all messages until the camera is
  recalibrated.  Note that self-calibrating systems may "recalibrate"
  frequently.
* Operational parameters.  These define the image region actually
  captured by the camera driver.  Although they affect the geometry of
  the output image, they may be changed freely without recalibrating
  the camera.

Calibration Parameters
''''''''''''''''''''''

The ``height`` and ``width`` fields always contain the image
dimensions with which the camera was calibrated; normally this will
be the full resolution of the camera.

The arrays of calibration parameters ``D``, ``K``, ``R`` and ``P`` are
interpreted as described in [#CameraInfo]_ [#OpenCV]_.  ``D`` contains
the parameters of the model named by the ``distortion_model`` string.

Recognized ``distortion_model`` names are given in the new header
``sensor_msgs/distortion_models.h``.  For Diamondback these will be
"plumb_bob" and "rational_polynomial", as described in
`Alternate Distortion Models`_.  Empty ``D`` and ``distortion_model``
indicate that the ``CameraInfo`` cannot be used to rectify points or
images, either because the camera is not calibrated or because the
rectified image was produced using an unsupported distortion model,
e.g. the proprietary one used by Bumblebee cameras [#Bumblebee]_.

Operational Parameters
''''''''''''''''''''''

Binning reduces the resolution of the output image to
``(width / binning_x)`` x ``(height / binning_y)``.  Consumers of
``CameraInfo`` (such as image_geometry) must scale the focal lengths
and principal point of the camera model.  Both supported distortion
models operate on normalized image coordinates (independent of focal
length and principal point), and the rotation matrix ``R`` on 3D world
coordinates, so binning does not affect these parameters.

For the sake of backwards compatibility, ``binning_x = binning_y = 0``
(the default values) is considered the same as
``binning_x = binning_y = 1``, or no binning.

The ROI is specified in the full (unbinned) image coordinates.  For
example, the 100x150 sub-rectangle at offset (25, 35) in a 2x2 binned
image is represented as a ROI with dimensions 200x300 and offset (50,
70).  The ROI specifies a sub-rectangle of pixels on the imager,
independent of binning.  ``x_offset`` and ``y_offset`` are the offset
from the top-left corner of the full image to the top-left corner of
the region of interest.

As a convenience, setting ``roi.x_offset``, ``roi.y_offset``,
``roi.width`` and ``roi.height`` all to 0 has a special meaning; it is
the same as the full resolution.  This is especially useful to users
of the polled camera interface [#PolledCamera]_, who can request a
full resolution image despite not knowing ahead of time what that
resolution is.  It also means that authors of camera drivers that do
not support ROI can safely ignore the ``CameraInfo/roi`` fields, which
default to 0.

The new field ``roi.do_rectify`` is discussed in the next section.

Raw and Rectified ROI
---------------------

When working with distorted images, a desired raw ROI can be given
directly to the camera driver.  More commonly, however, the consumer
wants the camera to provide an ROI in the rectified image, and does not
particularly care how the rectified image patch is acquired.  To bridge
the gap between user (who works in rectified coordinates) and camera
driver (which understands only raw coordinates), we define a mapping
between raw and rectified ROI.

Given a rectified ROI, the corresponding raw ROI is the smallest
sub-rectangle such that every pixel in the rectified ROI maps to a
point inside the raw ROI.  In other words, the raw ROI must contain
all the information needed to fill the rectified ROI.  Geometrically,
if we distort the outline of the rectified ROI into raw coordinates,
the raw ROI circumscribes the resulting curve.

Likewise, given a raw ROI, the corresponding rectified ROI is the
largest sub-rectangle such that every pixel in the rectified ROI maps
to a point inside the raw ROI.  If we rectify the outline of the raw
ROI, the rectified ROI inscribes the resulting curve.

When a full resolution image is captured, the behavior is different.
During the camera calibration process, the user chooses a scaling
which trades off between having all valid pixels in the rectified
image (but discarding some pixels from the raw image) versus discarding
no raw image pixels (but permitting invalid pixels in the rectified
image).  The assumption that all rectified pixels should be valid does
not necessarily hold; that is up to the user to decide during calibration.
The raw and rectified images have the same resolution, and hence the
same "ROI" (the full image).  ``roi.do_rectify`` is set to ``False``
to indicate that no ROI mapping should be done.

When the raw ROI is only part of the full resolution, ``roi.do_rectify``
is set to ``True``.  The raw ROI is mapped to the rectified ROI as
described above.

It is permitted to set ``roi.do_rectify = False`` when the ROI is
not actually the same as the full image resolution to suppress the
ROI mapping.  This feature can be useful in special situations, for
example if the camera supports particular video modes with the
resolution cropped to a smaller field of view.  See use case
`#3 Cropped Video Mode`_ below.

To complete the set of possibilities, the user could request an ROI
of the full image resolution but with ``roi.do_rectify = True``.
This ensures that the rectified image contains no invalid pixels, but
it will also discard pixels from the raw image.

Polled Camera Interface
-----------------------

The ``polled_camera/GetPolledImage`` service is updated as below::

    string response_namespace

    uint32 binning_x                   # New field
    uint32 binning_y                   # New field

    sensor_msgs/RegionOfInterest roi
      uint32 x_offset
      uint32 y_offset
      uint32 height
      uint32 width
      bool do_rectify                  # New field
    ---
    bool success                       # New field
    string status_message              # New field
    time stamp

This revision allows users to specify the binning as well as the ROI.
It also allows the camera driver to return failure (and an explanatory
message) if the request could not be met; see `Guidelines for Camera
Drivers`_ below.

Guidelines for Camera Drivers
-----------------------------

The main purpose of a camera driver is to expose useful functions of
the camera hardware.  If a camera does not support binning or ROI in
hardware, the driver has no obligation to implement these features in
software; indeed, that might mislead users as to the camera's actual
capabilities.  Such post-processing can always be performed by a
separate node.

`Raw and Rectified ROI`_ described a range of ways in which the ROI
fields may be set for different purposes.  In practice most camera
drivers only need one or two behaviors.  When capturing at full
resolution, ``CameraInfo/roi`` can be left at the default of all zeros
to signify full resolution.  Drivers that do not support ROI need not
touch ``CameraInfo/roi`` at all.  When the user has requested some
ROI (perhaps through ``dynamic_reconfigure``), the driver should set
``CameraInfo/roi`` with the ROI offsets and size used and
``do_rectify = True``.

Drivers are not obligated to implement the polled camera interface
[#PolledCamera]_.  This feature is most useful for cameras that
support software triggering or one-shot capture, and especially
high-resolution cameras that may be expensive to stream at full
resolution.

If a ``GetPolledImage`` request asks for binning settings that the
camera does not support, the driver shall return failure
(``success = False``).  If the request asks for a ROI that is not
full resolution and the camera does not support ROI, or if the
requested ROI does not match any available camera resolution, the
driver shall return failure.  There may be cases when the camera
supports ROI but cannot achieve precisely the ROI requested, e.g. if
the camera requires the ROI offsets to be multiples of the binning
sizes.  In that situation the driver should *expand* the requested ROI
to one attainable by the camera, return success, and set
``CameraInfo/roi`` to the expanded ROI.  ``roi.do_rectify`` should
always be copied as-is from the request to the output ``CameraInfo``.

image_geometry API
------------------

Several new methods will be added to image_geometry's
``PinholeCameraModel`` class [#pinhole]_.  The signatures below are
for C++; the Python API will be equivalent.

::

    class PinholeCameraModel
    {
      // Resolution of the camera when it was calibrated
      cv::Size fullResolution() const;

      // Current resolution. May be reduced by binning, or by ROI
      // when roi.do_rectify == False
      cv::Size currentResolution() const;

      // The current binning settings
      int binningX() const;
      int binningY() const;

      // The current raw and rectified ROIs
      cv::Rect rawRoi() const;
      cv::Rect rectRoi() const;

      // Compute the rectified ROI corresponding to a given raw ROI
      cv::Rect rectifyRoi(cv::Rect roi_raw) const;

      // Compute the raw ROI corresponding to a given rectified ROI.
      // The second overload is more convenient for use with the
      // polled_camera interface.
      cv::Rect unrectifyRoi(cv::Rect roi_rect) const;
      void unrectifyRoi(cv::Rect roi_rect,
                        sensor_msgs::RegionOfInterest& roi_raw) const;
    };

Internally, ``PinholeCameraModel`` will be updated to compute the
rectified ROI from ``CameraInfo/roi``, and will use it when
(un)rectifying points and images.

Use Cases
=========

Here we examine how a camera driver might fill the ``CameraInfo`` message
in different modes of operation, roughly increasing in complexity.
We use the WGE100 camera [#WGE100]_ as an example.  This camera has
752x480 resolution, but is commonly used in 640x480 mode, which crops
the left-most and right-most 56 columns of the imager.  It supports
both binning and ROI.

The camera is calibrated only once, in full 752x480 resolution.  The
same camera parameters (``height``, ``width``, ``D``, ``K``, ``R``,
``P``) are reused in all cases.  They are combined with the driver's
current operational parameters (``binning_x``, ``binning_y``, ``roi``)
to derive the geometry of the output images.

#1 Full Resolution
------------------

The most basic case - we capture full 752x480 images.  The relevant
``CameraInfo`` settings are::

    height: 480
    width:  752
    binning_x: 0
    binning_y: 0
    roi
        offset_x:   0
        offset_y:   0
        height:     0
        width:      0
        do_rectify: False

For this example we have left the binning and ROI fields at their
defaults of 0.  Drivers that do not support binning and/or ROI do not
need to touch these fields at all.  The above message has the same
meaning as::

    height: 480
    width:  752
    binning_x: 1
    binning_y: 1
    roi
        offset_x:   0
        offset_y:   0
        height:     480
        width:      752
        do_rectify: False

#2 Region of Interest
---------------------

Let's capture a 200x300 ROI with top left corner (50, 70)::

    height: 480
    width:  752
    binning_x: 1
    binning_y: 1
    roi
        offset_x:   50
        offset_y:   70
        height:     300
        width:      200
        do_rectify: True

The driver simply needs to fill in the ``roi`` field.
``roi.do_rectify`` is now set to ``True``, as the best-fitting
rectified ROI may overlap poorly with the original raw ROI.

#3 Cropped Video Mode
---------------------

Now we change the camera to 640x480 mode, cropping 56 columns on each
side::

    height: 480
    width:  752
    binning_x: 1
    binning_y: 1
    roi
        offset_x:   56
        offset_y:   0
        height:     480
        width:      640
        do_rectify: False

The cropping effect of the lower-resolution mode is encoded in
``CameraInfo`` as a ROI.  ``roi.do_rectify = False`` because we wish
to pretend that we are in fact running a 640x480 camera at full
resolution.  The rectified image will also be 640x480.

#4 Cropped Video Mode with ROI
------------------------------

Again capturing a 200x300 ROI with top left corner (50, 70), this time
with respect to the 640x480 image::

    height: 480
    width:  752
    binning_x: 1
    binning_y: 1
    roi
        offset_x:   106
        offset_y:   70
        height:     300
        width:      200
        do_rectify: True

Notice that the ROI in ``CameraInfo`` is actually specified in the full
752x480 resolution we calibrated with.  ``roi.offset_x = 106 = 56 + 50``.

#5 Binned, Cropped Video Mode
-----------------------------

Staying in 640x480 cropped video mode, we enable 2x2 binning::

    height: 480
    width:  752
    binning_x: 2
    binning_y: 2
    roi
        offset_x:   56
        offset_y:   0
        height:     480
        width:      640
        do_rectify: False

The output resolution is reduced to 320x240.  Since ROI is specified
in unbinned coordinates, the ``roi`` fields are unchanged from #3.

#6 Binned, Cropped Video Mode with ROI
--------------------------------------

Finally, we capture the same ROI as in #4::

    height: 480
    width:  752
    binning_x: 2
    binning_y: 2
    roi
        offset_x:   106
        offset_y:   70
        height:     300
        width:      200
        do_rectify: True

Again, the ``roi`` fields are unchanged from #4.

Rationale
=========

Why Include Operational Parameters
----------------------------------

In defining ``CameraInfo``, we have included both calibration parameters
(fixed until the next calibration) and operational parameters (set by
the camera driver, may change freely).  The `Use Cases`_ section
demonstrates how the operational parameters can be used to describe a
variety of useful capture modes without recalibrating.

One could ask, however, why include the operational parameters in
``CameraInfo`` at all?  Binning rescales the focal lengths and principal
point.  The ROI offset shifts the principal point.  A major alternative
approach is to modify the projection matrix in the camera driver to
describe the geometry of the individual output image.  We have three
objections to this approach.

First is separation of concerns.  In ROS we consider camera drivers to
have a very specific function: read pixels off the imager, shove them
directly into a ``sensor_msgs/Image`` message, and publish.  They are
not expected to understand the camera model at all, merely regurgitate
the calibration parameters provided to them externally.  This keeps
drivers simple and focused, and avoids requiring external dependencies
such as OpenCV.

Second, the operational parameters are useful information in certain
vision tasks, particularly ones which actively interact with the
camera.  The initial motivation for including ROI in ``CameraInfo`` was
an application which tracked a small object at high speed by updating
the ROI of a high-definition camera after each detection [#Milestone2]_.
In this case, we needed to know the ROI of the incoming image to
calculate the updated ROI.

Third, ``CameraInfo`` as specified permits some convenient optimizations.
Without getting deeply into implementation details, rectifying a full
resolution image for the first time is a fairly heavyweight operation.
It involves generating matrices mapping each rectified pixel to a
location in the raw image.  These maps can be reused, however, on
subsequent images, greatly reducing the expense of rectification.
Furthermore, when ROI is used you can cheaply extract and use the
same ROI from the full resolution map; this is a nice win when the
ROI is frequently changing, as in the tracking application mentioned
above.  With the alternate approach, changing the ROI likely entails
generating a new map specific to that ROI.

Unbinned Coordinates for ROI
----------------------------

The original draft of this REP expressed ROI in binned coordinates with
the theory that this is slightly more intuitive to the user.  One
problem is that binned coordinates are less expressive than the full
resolution coordinates; they do not allow bins that start at
coordinates that are not multiples of the binning factor.  Another
advantage of using unbinned coordinates is that the ROI represents the
same field of view regardless of the binning settings.

The IIDC (DCAM) 1394 specification [#IIDC1394]_ uses unbinned
coordinates and explicitly does allow "off-grid" ROIs in ``Format_7``
(Partial Image Size Format) modes.  In contrast, the GenICam Standard
Features Naming Convention [#GenICam]_ uses binned coordinates for
ROI.  Thus there is some disagreement among standards, but in the
absence of any strong argument for using binned coordinates we opt for
the technical advantages of unbinned coordinates.

Rejected Features
-----------------

Some requested features are not included in this REP, generally
because we do not see enough benefit to justify the added complexity.

Different Dimensions for Rectified Image
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

At least one user has wanted to make the dimensions of the rectified
image larger than those of the raw image [#Resize]_.  The advantage is
that the rectified image can contain all of the pixels from the raw
image without under-sampling them.  When packing all of the original
pixels into a rectified image with the same dimensions, some details
can be lost, especially when there is significant radial distortion.

Implementation-wise, this is not particularly difficult.  It requires
adding fields to ``CameraInfo`` for the dimensions of the rectified image
at full resolution, analogous to ``height`` and ``width``.
image_geometry would use these fields when creating the rectification
maps.  We would add some way to select different dimensions in
camera_calibration_.

While potentially nice to have, we need more convincing that this
feature is actually necessary.  camera_calibration's alpha slider
[#CalibTut]_ already allows the user to choose a trade-off between
using all of the original pixels and preserving detail.  The cost of
adding this feature is some measure of additional complexity, and it
is likely to cause confusion.  It might break code that assumes the
rectified image has the same dimensions as the raw image at full
resolution.

Finally, if truly needed, this behavior could be implemented as a node
publishing the enlarged and rectified image and a tweaked ``CameraInfo``
to a separate namespace.  This solution loses the ability to unrectify
points back to the original image resolution, but this a minor
drawback.

Publish CameraInfo Only When Parameters Change
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

One FAQ is, "Why send ``CameraInfo`` with every Image message?  Why not
only once?"  The main answer is that operational parameters (binning,
ROI) may change, perhaps rapidly, from image to image.  Even the
calibration parameters may be updated regularly in self-calibrating
systems.

The natural follow-up question is, "Why not send ``CameraInfo`` only when
it changes?"  The biggest issue is that when the ``CameraInfo`` does
change, how do you synchronize that change with the Image stream on
the client side?  Either you go ahead with the most recent parameters,
risking garbage interpretation if the new ``CameraInfo`` has not arrived
yet, or you wait for a ``CameraInfo`` that most of the time will not be
sent.  Worst of all, what if a ``CameraInfo`` update gets dropped?  In any
case, the potential savings are meager, as ``CameraInfo`` is much smaller
than the typical ``Image`` message.

To be fair, this question most recently came up in the context of a
camera with a proprietary (and large) distortion model [#Bumblebee]_.
Including this model in every ``CameraInfo`` message would indeed waste
a large amount of bandwidth.  Obviously, though, we can't support this
proprietary model, and the thread suggested good alternative
solutions.  As long as ``CameraInfo`` remains small relative to an
``Image``, we see no reason to complicate matters in pursuit of tiny
bandwidth optimizations.

Mirroring
'''''''''

Some cameras [#WGE100]_ support effects such as flipping the image
horizontally or vertically, or rotating the entire image 180 degrees.
With flags for these settings in ``CameraInfo``, it would be possible to
update the calibration parameters with respect to the mirroring.
However, this adds complexity in support of a relatively rare feature,
and we do not see a compelling use case for changing the mirroring
settings after calibrating the camera.  The user should look at the
raw images, mirror them into the desired orientation, and then consider
those settings fixed prior to calibration.

Other Camera Settings
'''''''''''''''''''''

Other settings came up in discussion such as exposure, gain, white
balance, color calibration, etc.  However these settings are highly
camera-dependent, and requiring drivers to convert camera-specific
values into some canonical representation would be a significant
burden.  Furthermore, the main purpose of ``CameraInfo`` is to
describe the geometry of the captured image, which is not affected by
settings such as exposure.

Information such as color calibration could certainly be useful to
post-processing nodes, but these settings could just as well be
published on some other dedicated topic rather than including them
in ``CameraInfo``.

Focus and Zoom
''''''''''''''

Some cameras support auto-focus, or allow users to set focus/zoom
programmatically.  These settings do change the optics of the camera,
and thus the geometry of the image.  Unfortunately, describing the
camera parameters as a function of focus is not a simple arithmetic
operation as it is with binning or ROI.  As far as we are aware,
calibrating for focus and zoom is still an open research area with no
firmly established solution.  It's also unclear how to define focus in
a camera-independent way.

For now, camera drivers that expose focus and zoom capabilities will
have to be "smarter" than the typical driver and update the camera
parameters themselves.  Such a driver might store multiple calibrations
for different focus settings, or use some more sophisticated model to
interpolate the camera parameters to the current focus.

Multiple Distortion Models
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Storing multiple distortion models in ``CameraInfo`` was suggested, so
that code not supporting some new distortion model could fall back to
a simpler one such as "plumb_bob".  But there are other, simpler
solutions to this problem, such as requiring users to upgrade their
code (or else calibrate the camera themselves), or shipping multiple
calibration files and allowing the user to select one compatible with
his system.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Nodes exclusively using image_geometry to interface with ``CameraInfo``
(as recommended) should continue to work with no changes.  In fact,
they will gain support for binning.

Nodes actively using ROI with rectified images, especially if they use
the polled camera interface [#PolledCamera]_, will need to be updated.
In fact we are not aware of any such nodes in current use.  People trying
to write them tend to get stymied by the issues with rectifying ROI
image patches [#RoiTicket]_.  We are not concerned about breaking
backwards compatibility with the old rectified ROI, because the old
behavior is already broken and therefore little-used.

The biggest pain point is that previously recorded bag files
containing ``CameraInfo`` will need to be migrated before they work
with Diamondback nodes.  Still, this is easily accomplished using
``rosbag fix``.  The migration rule will fill in the new / modified
fields as follows::

    distortion_model = "plumb_bob"
    D copied as-is
    binning_x = 1
    binning_y = 1
    roi.do_rectify = (roi.width > 0 && roi.width < width) ||
                     (roi.height > 0 && roi.height < height)

TODO: Define updates to the INI and YAML files used to store
calibrations.

Reference Implementation
========================

The new features are not yet implemented in image_geometry.  I'd like
to reach consensus before investing the coding effort.
