Abstract
========

This REP describes a "rosdep 2" tool that is significantly different
from its predecessor [1]_.  This new version uses a "sources list",
similar in semantics to the ``apt`` tool [2]_.  It is also a standalone
tool that can be separately installed and used with or without a ROS
package system.

This specification is meant to be minimal.  See "Future Improvements"
for possible extensions.


Example workflow
================

The example workflows below provide a high-level sketch of how rosdep
2 is used.  The main differences are:

 1. Standalone installation.
 2. Installation requires an ``init`` and ``update`` step to create
    the local database.
 3. More querying APIs.


Installation::

    sudo pip install -U rosdep
    sudo rosdep init
    rosdep update

Common installation workflow::

    $ rosdep check ros_comm
    All system dependencies have been satisified
    $ rosdep install geometry

Querying::

    $ rosdep keys roscpp
    pkg-config

    $ rosdep resolve pkg-config
    pkg-config

    $ rosdep keys geometry
    eigen
    apr
    glut
    python-sip
    python-numpy
    graphviz
    paramiko
    cppunit
    libxext
    log4cxx
    pkg-config

    $ rosdep resolve eigen
    libeigen3-dev



Resolution specification
========================

rosdep 2 loads *valid data sources* specified in the sources list in
order.  This follows the behavior of apt, which designates the "most
preferred source listed first."

Each rosdep entry from the data sources is combined into a single
rosdep database.  Entries from data sources listed higher in the
sources have higher precedence.

A data source is considered *valid* if all of its tags match the local
tags.  A data source with no tags is always loaded.


Tags
----

The following tags are set for the local rosdep instance:

- ``ROS-DISTRO-CODENAME``, e.g. ``fuerte``
- ``OS-NAME``, e.g. ``ubuntu``
- ``OS-VERSION-CODENAME``, e.g. ``lucid``

For example, on Ubuntu Lucid 10.04, with the ROS Fuerte distribution,
the tags for the local rosdep instance would be: ``fuerte, ubuntu,
lucid``.

``OS-NAME`` and ``OS-VERSION-CODENAME`` are the same values that the
``rosdep.yaml`` file format uses [3]_.  NOTE: REP 111 refers to
``OS-VERSION-CODENAME`` as ``OS_VERSION``.  Here we attach
``CODENAME`` to explicitly refer to the codename, not the numerical
version marker.


Conflict resolution
-------------------

There are no longer conflicts in rosdep 2.  ``rosdep.yaml`` files are
processed in order of precedence, with the first entry for a rosdep
key "winning".  Subsequent entries for the same key, even if they are
non-conflicting, are not merged.

Caching
-------

rosdep 2 always loads its database from a local cache.  The user must
explicitly update this local cache to get new resolution rules.


File format specification
=========================

This specification uses the same ``rosdep.yaml`` file format as
defined in REP 111 [3]_ and also described more concisely in [4]_.

Data sources .list format
-------------------------

A ``.list`` file lists *data sources*, with the most preferred data
source first.  The general format is::

    source-type uri [tags...]

Where ``source-type`` can be:

  ``yaml``

     ``rosdep.yaml`` file   

  ``gbpdistro``

    ``gbpdistro`` file.


Lines that start with a ``#`` are considered to be comments.

Example file::

    yaml https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/base.yaml
    yaml https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/python.yaml
    gbpdistro https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/releases/fuerte.yaml fuerte

    
gbpdistro files
---------------

``gbpdistro`` refers to a ``git-buildpackage``-based toolchain
currently in use for building REP 122-compliant stacks.  This
toolchain is still in a prototype phase; thus, this ``gbpdistro``
specification is unstable.

This REP does not define the ``gbpdistro`` format, but it is assumed
to be a YAML file with that conforms to::

    gbp-repos:
    - name: NAME1
      target: all
      url: git://github.com/PROJECT1/REPO1.git
    - name: NAME2
      target: [lucid, oneiric]
      url: git://github.com/PROJECT2/REPO2.git
    release-name: RELEASE-NAME


rosdep 2 can create a data source based on a ``gbpdistro`` file.  For
each entry in the ``gbp-repos`` key, rosdep 2 produces a rosdep key
for ``NAME`` that maps to the Ubuntu package name
``ros-<RELEASE-NAME>-<NAME>``.  In the future, this mechanism could
also be used to produce rosdep key mappings for other platforms, like
OS X Homebrew.

rosdep 2 uses a "targets" file that provides a lookup table for
resolving ``all`` targets based on ``RELEASE-NAME``. The targets files
is a machine-readable representation of REP 3 [7]_.


/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d
------------------------------

rosdep 2 uses a similar definition as apt ``sources.list.d`` [2]_:

       The ``/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d`` directory provides a way
       to add entries in separate files.  File names need to end with
       .list and may only contain letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9),
       underscore (_), hyphen (-) and period (.) characters. Otherwise
       they will be silently ignored.


For simplicity, we don't implement an ``/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list``
and instead soley use the ``/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/``
implementation, which is much easier for idempotent configuration by
scripts.


Command-line specification
==========================

Updated rosdep commands
-----------------------

``db``

    No longer takes in any arguments and uses the easier to type
    ``db`` instead of ``depdb``.  The database that is used to resolve
    rosdep keys is determined by the sources list, and thus is not
    dependent on a particular resource (e.g. ROS package or stack).
    The previous ``depdb`` command is still processed but not
    promoted.

``what-needs <rosdeps>``

``where-defined <rosdeps>``

    Both commands are the same as their predecessors, but use a more
    consistent dash separator.  The previous versions are supported
    but not promoted.

New rosdep commands
-------------------

``init``
    
    Initializes a default ``/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d`` directory
    for the user.  This is a bootstrapping command that only needs to
    be run once, most likely as::

        sudo rosdep init


``keys <stacks-and-packages>``

    List the rosdep keys that the ROS stacks and packages depend on.
    This command only works with a ``ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`` set.
    
``resolve <rosdeps>``

    Prints the resolution of the listed rosdeps to the console.  This
    enables users to easily query rosdep and verify its behavior.  It
    is meant to be used together with the ``keys`` command.

``update``

    Processes ``/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d`` and downloads new
    datafiles for the local database.  This is the only command that
    examines remote sources.  All other commands are processed against
    local data.


    

Motivation
==========

The original rosdep gave preference to the developer of a ROS stack.
It enabled that developer to declare dependency rules and distribute
them with the stack.  As a corollary, it strongly favored
reproducibility and correctness: old source trees could be checked out
and be built the same way.  As a result of these goals, rosdep rules
were stored with code.  Also, aggregation of rules in lower-level
stacks was frowned upon, as it would restrict downstream developers

This design has not scaled very well.  There are several issues, in
particular, that have strongly motivated a redesign:

- Updates the the rosdep rules for new platforms requires re-releasing
  code, even though the code is unchanged.  This creates significant
  delays porting ROS to new platforms.
- Conflicts require re-releasing code to resolve.
- Different stacks see different resolution databases, which creates
  confusion.
- Rosdep aggregator stacks, like ``common_rosdeps`` become inevitable to
  avoid conflicting and duplicating rules.

The rosdep 2 design favors the end-user as well as maintainers of
software distributions.  The main goals of rosdep 2 are:

 1. Clarity of resolution.
 2. Easily end-user control over rosdep resolution.

The semantics of Ubuntu's ``apt`` tool are followed as much as
possible to provide familiarity.


Backwards compatibility
=======================

stack/rosdep.yaml
-----------------

The main incompatibility is rosdep 2 does not read ``rosdep.yaml``
files from ROS stacks.  It only loads from data sources in the sources
list.

Command-line API
----------------

There are minor incompatibilities in the command-line API.  The main
installation commands are also the same, so many scripts based on
rosdep are likely to continue to work.  However, the new rosdep
command requires an initialization/update step to create the rosdep
database, which may cause some initial incompatibilities.  Scripts
that use rosdep and run on freshly installed machines, such as
chroots, will be especially effected.

The output format of some commands, like ``db`` and ``where-defined``
have been changed for clarity and easier processing.  As far as the
author knows, no scripts depend on the output format of these
commands.

For example, rosdep 1::

    $ rosdep where_defined eigen
    eigen defined in set(['/opt/ros/electric/stacks/common_rosdeps/rosdep.yaml', ">>/opt/ros/electric/stacks/common_rosdeps/rosdep.yaml<<Unused due to package 'common_rosdeps' being in a stack.]]"])

rosdep 2::

   $ rosdep where-defined eigen
   https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/base.yaml


rosmake
-------

rosmake no longer has options for invoking rosdep internally as rosdep
is now an external tool.

Rationale
=========

New querying APIs
-----------------

Although the querying APIs go beyond the minimal specification
necessary for rosdep 2, they were useful in its development as they
provide command-line verification of the resolution behavior.  For the
same reasons, the new querying APIs make rosdep's behavior more clear
to the end user.  Users can see the rosdep keys that are tied to a
particular ROS package.  The user can also see how those keys relate
to system dependencies prior to performing installation.

New conflict rules
------------------

The new rosdep eschews conflict in favor of clarity.  A particular
rosdep entry always comes from a single source, and the source that is
chosen is the one that is ranked highest.  An alternative would have
been to merge compatible rules for a rosdep key, such as rules that
have non-intersecting OSes.  This would mean that entries could come
from multiple sources, which is less clear.


Lack of backwards compatibility
-------------------------------

The initial reference implementation loaded ``rosdep.yaml`` files from
stacks as well, but it increased confusion.  Based on the specific
implementation:

- rosdep entries from the sources list were shadowed by stack-based
  ``rosdep.yaml`` files.
- or, stack-based ``rosdep.yaml`` files were shadowed by rosdep entries
  loaded from the sources list.

Either of these conflicts with the goal of providing clear resolution
to the user.  Furthermore, it requires maintaining dual sets of
``rosdep.yaml`` files.


No support for ROS_ETC_DIR
--------------------------

rosdep 2 does not obey the ``ROS_ETC_DIR`` environment variable defined in REP 124 [6]_.
This decision was made for four reasons:

 1. Confusing behavior with ``rosdep init``, which is run under
    ``sudo`` and thus would require an extra command-line arguments to
    preserve environment variables.
 2. Conflicts with goal of clarity.  rosdep always uses the same local database.
 3. "tags" in the ``.list`` file format implicitly support multiple distributions.
 4. rosdep 2 is a standalone tool not included with any ROS distribution.


Future improvements
===================

rosdep keys as arguments to package-based commands
--------------------------------------------------

The following rosdep command take in ``<stacks-and-packages>`` as arguments:

- check
- install
- keys
- resolve

In order to support ``rosdep`` as its own standalone tool, it is easy
to imagine extending each of those commands to take rosdep keys as
well.

This improvement has strong synergy with ROS Fuerte, which transitions
lower-level stacks to be rosdep keys.  For example, ``ros_comm`` is
both a stack name and a rosdep key.

More configurability
--------------------

The ``rosdep init`` and ``rosdep update`` commands will likely need
more configurability than their current bare specification provide.
For example, it will be desirable to configure them to use a different
sources list than ``/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d``.


Reference implementation
========================

The ``rosdep2`` package provides a reference implementation of this specification.
It can be installed via ``pip``::

    sudo pip install -U rosdep


A mercurial repository is available at ``https://kforge.ros.org/rosrelease/rosdep``.

The reference implementation is not yet fully compatible with this
specification.
