Abstract
========

This REP describes an 'install' target for ROS.  This proposal describes a
file/directory layout policy and extensions to the rosbuild API to support
installation.  It also notes some known and expected issues with installation,
particularly regarding updating existing code to support installation.

Specification
=============

The install prefix: ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX
--------------------------------------

Installation is done relative to a prefix, ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX, which is
an absolute path.  The prefix is specified externally (e.g., by the user
doing the install, or by a packaging tool like pbuilder).  For system
installs, ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX is often /usr, sometimes /usr/local.
For a non-system install, it might be anything.

The stack is the installation unit
----------------------------------

In ROS code, the stack is the installation unit; it is at the stack level
that we make releases, check versions, create binary packages, etc.  So
the install target also works at a stack level.  To install a stack:

::

  roscd <stack>
  make install

The install target is not supported at the level of an individual package
(though an install target does exist there, for use by the stack-level
install target).

Filesystem layout
-----------------

The overall layout is:

::

  ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/
    bin/          : "important" executables, such as rospack and rostopic
    lib/          : all C/C++ shared and static libraries from all packages
      ros/        : the ROS package tree, grouped into stacks
      ros/ros     : the ros stack; ROS_ROOT points here
      ros/<stack> : other stacks are siblings to the ros stack

So a package 'foo', contained in a stack 'bar', can be found at
ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/ros/bar/foo.  And ROS_ROOT is always
ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/ros/ros.

Within a package, the layout is:

::

  ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/ros/<stack>/<package>/
    bin/ : C/C++ executables

Other package content can be organized in whatever way is convenient.

What gets installed
-------------------

The installation system takes a "whitelist" approach.  Only those
elements that are specifically called out for installation via the
rosbuild installation API (see below) are installed.  The following package
elements are installed automatically, into the package directory:

- manifest.xml
- If rosbuild_genmsg() was called, then .msg files and source files that
  are generated from them are installed.
- If rosbuild_gensrv() was called, then .srv files and source files that
  are generated from them are installed.
- Other generators must arrange for installation of their outputs (e.g.,
  actionlib_msgs should arrange to install .action files and possibly the
  .msg files that result, though those might be handled by rosbuild).

NOTE: while rosbuild will install the .msg and .srv files, the
individual client libraries' CMake code that arranges for code generation
should install the generated files.  It's the client libraries that know
exactly which files will be generated.  In this way, we can avoid the
recursive copy.  This behavior is not currently present in the reference
implementation.

Nothing else is installed automatically.  So, for example, if you want
to install a library, you need to call rosbuild_install_library();
see below for details.

RPATH handling
--------------

So that executables can be used from a package source tree, rosbuild
makes extensive use of RPATH entries.  These entries are added at link
time, and constitute paths to be searched at runtime for libraries that
are needed by the executable.  Reliance on RPATHS is unusual, brittle
(e.g., a built ROS tree can't be moved and reused without cleaning and
rebuilding), and discouraged by distribution maintainers (e.g., Debian's
stance [#debrpath]_, which is probably inherited by Ubuntu).

The proposed install target will strip RPATH entries from all
executables (including shared libraries).  This is done via CMake's
support for modifying RPATH during installation [#cmakerpath]_.  Because all
libraries are installed into ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib, the installed
RPATH-less executables can be used so long as ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib
is in the dynamic linker's search path.  For a system install, where
ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX is something like /usr, ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib is in
the standard search path.  For a custom install, the user might need to
add ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or equivalent).


rosbuild API changes
--------------------

The macros below will be added to rosbuild.  These macros can be called
from a package's CMakeLists.txt file.

- ``rosbuild_install_executable(exe [INSTALL_TO_ROOT])``: Install the
  C/C++ executable exe, stripped of RPATH entries, to the bin subdirectory
  of the package (i.e., ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/ros/<stack>/<package>/bin).
  If the INSTALL_TO_ROOT option is given, the executable is instead
  installed to ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin; this option is intended only for
  "important" executables, such as rospack and rostopic.
- rosbuild_install_library(lib [INSTALL_TO_PACKAGE]): Install the C/C++
  library lib, stripped of RPATH entries, to ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib.
  If the INSTALL_TO_PACKAGE option is given, then the library is
  instead installed to the lib subdirectory of the package (i.e.,
  ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/ros/<stack>/<package>/lib); use of this option
  is discouraged, as it puts the library in a non-standard place.
- rosbuild_install_files(files...): Install the listed files to the
  package directory.  Each file is installed in the same package-relative
  location that it currently occupies.  Intermediate directories are
  created automatically if needed.  Files are installed without execute
  permission.  For example:

  ::

    rosbuild_install_files(foo/bar/bat)

  would install the file bat to the directory
  ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/ros/<stack>/<package>/foo/bar/.
- rosbuild_install_programs(programs...): Same as
  rosbuild_install_files(), but the files are installed with execute
  permission.
- rosbuild_install_directory(dir): Recursively install the directory
  dir to the package directory.  The directory is installed to the same
  package-relative location that it currently occupies.  Intermediate
  directories are created automatically if needed.  Directories and files
  are installed using the same permissions that they currently have.  For
  examples:

  ::

    rosbuild_install_directory(foo/bar/baz)

  would install the directory baz, and all of its contents, to the
  directory ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/ros/<stack>/<package>/foo/bar.

Non-rosbuild-controlled packages
--------------------------------

Some packages don't use rosbuild, and so can't make use of the installation
API described above.  The installation system identifies a package as
rosbuild-controlled if there is a CMakeLists.txt file in the top of the
package directory; otherwise, the package is considered to be
non-rosbuild-controlled.

There are two general categories of non-rosbuild-controlled packages:

- 3rdparty packages, such as gtest; and 
- packages that don't build anything, such as roslaunch.

Both kinds of packages are handled in the same fashion, which is to
recursively copy the entire package directory from the source tree to the
install tree (directories named build and .svn are filtered out during the
copy).

**KNOWN ISSUE**: 3rdparty packages can include C/C++ shared libraries,
which should be moved to ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib.  The details for doing
that move are TBD.  One possibility is to move anything that's found in a
directory that the package exports as a library search (-L) directory.
Just moving "\*.so" isn't good enough, because it's often a symlink, and you
need want the various versioned files (libfoo.so.0, libfoo.so.0.0.0, etc.).
A further point is that, if a 3rdparty package depends on another ROS
package (which should be rare), then the executables (including shared 
libraries) that are produced by that 3rdparty package might have RPATH
entries, which should be stripped.

Installations of multiple distributions
---------------------------------------

ROS code is organized into distributions (e.g., boxturtle, cturtle).  It
may be desirable to maintain installations of multiple distributions on a
single system.  The current binary .debs allow this kind of installation by
segmenting each distribution into its own subdirectory (e.g.,
/opt/ros/boxturtle, /opt/ros/cturtle).  That approach could be taken for the
installed package tree (e.g., ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/ros/boxturtle,
ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/ros/cturtle), but the C/C++ libraries would still
conflict with each other in ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib.

The present proposal envisions a single ROS installation in any given
ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX.  No support is provided for multiple installation in
one prefix.  Multiple installations would have to go into multiple
ROS_INSTALL_PREFIXes, which would likely entail the use of LD_LIBRARY_PATH
at runtime.

Motivation
==========

To date, there has been no 'make install' for ROS code.  The ROS
build system and associated tools were designed to support building in and
running from a packages source tree.  This design works well in
research-like environments, where everybody has his or her own copy of
the code checked out from version control.  But it is not appropriate for
providing system installations of ROS, e.g., as Debian packages (.debs).
The current best practice for such installations is to recursively copy
from a built package source tree, combined with heuristic filtering and
RPATH-rewriting.

Rationale
=========

The overall goal of install target is to allow for the installation of
ROS code.  More specifically, the install target should:

- install only what is needed at runtime;
- not rely on RPATH or RUNPATH settings;
- conform to accepted filesystem layouts (e.g., the Filesystem Heirarchy
  Standard [#fhs]_)
- provide developers with sufficient control over what is installed
  and where it goes;
- simplify common installation tasks; and
- have minimal impact on the ROS codebase.

To understand the implications of these specific goals, we'll take a couple
of strawman examples:

- A very simple installation method is to recursively copy everything from a 
  package source tree.  This method is disqualified because it is not
  minimal, and does not resolve the use of RPATH.
- One installation method is do away with the ROS package tree, putting
  the various pieces of each package into the best-fit locations in the
  system directory hierarchy: put libraries in /usr/lib, 
  executables in /usr/bin, .launch/.urdf/.mesh files in /usr/share,
  Python modules in /usr/lib/site-packages, etc.  This method is
  disqualified because a great deal of ROS code relies on the package
  tree to find and refer to resources in a package-relative manner;
  getting rid of the package tree would be hugely disruptive.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

If nothing is done to an existing package, then what happens during 'make
install' will depend on what kind of package it is:

- rosbuild-controlled packages: See above (basically manifest.xml,
  message and service directories will be installed to
  ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/ros/<stack>/<package>).
- non-rosbuild-controlled packages: As specified above, the entire package 
  directory will be recursively copied to 
  ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/ros/<stack>/<package>.

Updating existing packages: the right way
-----------------------------------------

The right way to add installation support to an existing package is
to call the appropriate rosbuild_install_*() macros for each of the
package elements that are required at runtime.  A common list of things to
consider for installation:

- C/C++ libraries
- C/C++ executables
- C/C++ header files, usually in <package>/include
- Python modules, usually in <package>/src/<package>
- Helper scripts, usually in <package>/scripts
- roslaunch files, usually in <package>/launch
- other data/configuration files (.urdf, .mesh, .xml, etc.)

In the end, it is up to the package or stack maintainer to decide what
should be installed, and there are some gray areas (e.g., small example
files that aren't strictly needed, but are not obtrusive and might
be useful).

Updating existing packages: the INSTALL_EVERYTHING option
---------------------------------------------------------------

Recognizing that it will be a significant effort to update all packages'
CMakeLists.txt to enumerate what needs to be installed, an option was added
to rosbuild_init.  This option enables an easy, automatable way of
adding naive installation support to existing packages.

- rosbuild_init([INSTALL_EVERYTHING]): If the INSTALL_EVERYTHING option is
  given, then the install target will recursively copy the entire package
  contents to the install location (directories called build or .svn are
  filtered out).

The INSTALL_EVERYTHING option essentially treats the package as
non-rosbuild-controlled, but it is implemented in such a way that C/C++
libraries and executables are stripped of RPATH entries and relocated
(i.e., libraries go to ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib and executables go to
ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/ros/<stack>/<package>/bin).

The INSTALL_EVERYTHING option is a crutch, and should not live long.
In fact, it may be removed before deployment, depending on how many
problems arise from using it.

Target names with slashes
-------------------------

CMake doesn't like target names with slashes in them (I believe that this
is official policy, but can't find a reference for it).  We often use
slashes when asking to build executables in subdirectories, e.g.:

::

  rosbuild_add_executable(bin/drop src/drop.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(bin/drop topic_tools)

Until now, this usage has caused problems only in isolated circumstances,
usually involving CMakeLists.txt in subdirectories.  But CMake's
installation system does not properly treat executables with target names
that have slashes.  In particular, it doesn't remove RPATH entries from
them during installation.  For example, asking to install the executable:

::

  rosbuild_install_executable(bin/drop)

will simply copy it, without removing the RPATH entry.

So existing packages must also be updated to not use slashes in
target names.  This can be done either via the per-target
RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property:

::

  rosbuild_add_executable(drop src/drop.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(drop topic_tools)
  set_target_properties(drop PROPERTIES RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY bin)
  rosbuild_install_executable(drop)

or via the global EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH variable:

::

  set(EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH bin)
  rosbuild_add_executable(drop src/drop.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(drop topic_tools)
  rosbuild_install_executable(drop)

Reference implementation
========================

An implementation is in progress at
https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros/branches/install_target (rev 11159
at time of writing).  To try
the implementation:

::

  svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros/branches/install_target ros
  export ROS_ROOT=`pwd`/ros
  export PATH=$ROS_ROOT/bin:$PATH
  export PYTHONPATH=$ROS_ROOT/core/roslib/src
  unset ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
  cd ros
  make install

The ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX is currently hardcoded as /tmp/ros-installed.  To
use the installation, configure your environment, including LD_LIBRARY_PATH
(needed because ROS_INSTALL_PREFIX is not a system location, such as /usr):

::

  export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
  export ROS_ROOT=/tmp/ros-installed/lib/ros/ros
  export PATH=/tmp/ros-installed/bin:$PATH
  unset ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
  source $ROS_ROOT/tools/rosbash/rosbash
  export PYTHONPATH=$ROS_ROOT/core/roslib/src:$PYTHONPATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/ros-installed/lib

Notes (valid at the time of writing):

- Most packages use the INSTALL_EVERYTHING option, and so are naively
  installed.
- A handful of packages have been updated to use the new rosbuild
  installation API:

  - roscpp
  - roslib
  - rosout
  - rospy
  - topic_tools

- While other stacks should be installable, only the ros stack has
  been tested.
- The implementation is missing the calls to install_name_tool needed for
  proper OSX support.
- Nothing has been tested on Windows.
