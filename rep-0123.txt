Abstract
========

This REP introduces the ``ROS_ETC_DIR`` and ``ROS_DISTRO`` environment
variables.  It also deprecates the use of ``ROS_ROOT``.  The
environment variables are related to the fileystem layout introduced
in REP 122 [1]_.

Specification
=============

The following two environment variables are introduced.

``ROS_ETC_DIR``

   Override path to ``/etc/ros`` directory.

``ROS_DISTRO``

   Override name of the currently active ROS distribution.  By default, this value is
   read from ``$ROS_ETC_DIR``/distro. 


The ``ROS_ROOT`` environment is deprecated, though it is not marked
for removal. The ``ROS_ROOT`` is also no longer required.  The only
valid use for ``ROS_ROOT`` moving forward is backwards-compatibility
for rosbuild-based ``Makefile`` and ``CMakeLists.txt`` includes.

All programs are strongly discouraged from using the ``ROS_ROOT``
environment variable to infer locations of resources other than the
use case noted above.

The complete set of ROS *filesystem* environment variables is
enumerated in the rospkg documentation [2]_.

The removal of resources from ``ROS_ROOT``-relative locations is
further discussed in REP 122 [1]_.

Motivation
==========

The ROS Fuerte release migrates many of the low-level libraries to use
a standard Filesystem Hierarchy Standard-like layout [3]_ contained in
a distribution-specific install prefix (e.g. ``/opt/ros/fuerte/``).

The implications of this new layout are several.  First, there 
ROS Fuerte introduces a new ``/etc/ros`` directory that contains
configuration files for ROS.  There are currently very few files in
this directory, but the contents are expected to increase over time.

Second, ROS binaries are now installed in a standard ``bin/``
directory instead of ``$ROS_ROOT/bin``, which removes one of the major
motivations for this environment variable.  Other uses of
``ROS_ROOT``, such as finding locations for log files and test
results, were migrated to use ``ROS_HOME`` instead.

Another major use of ``ROS_ROOT``, adding ROS packages to the package
search path, is easily migrated to use ``ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`` directly.
The precedence of ``ROS_ROOT`` on the package search path has been
problematic in the past as it prevents easily overriding packages that
are part of the ``ros`` stack.

Finally, the active ROS distribution codename (e.g. ``fuerte``)
continues to be important information used for packaging and version
detection, especially with the underlying changes to the filesystem
layout.  

Rationale
=========

We considered a more general environment variable to point to the
install prefix instead of ``ROS_ETC_DIR``.  While such a setting is
more general, it encodes additional assumptions about the filesystem
layout, such as the `etc/ros` directory structure beneath this path.
This is not desireable for cross-platform support.  Furthermore,
redirecting just this directory can be advantageous as it enables
manipulation of just the configuration files.

The ``ROS_DISTRO`` environment variable provides easy integration with
various tools that need to alter behavior based on this setting.  The
additional requirement to check ``ROS_ETC_DIR/distro`` seems an
unnecessary inconvenience, but it motivated by the desire to enable
future versions of ROS to operate without any special environment
variables.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

``ROS_ROOT`` points to a directory location that retains the same
structure and contents for paths to the ``mk`` and ``rosbuild``
packages.  This preserves commonly used include behavior in
``CMakeLists.txt`` and ``Makefile`` files, such as::

    include($ENV{ROS_ROOT}/core/rosbuild/rosbuild.cmake)

This location also contains legacy ``rosdep.yaml`` and ``stack.xml``
files.  Programs should not rely on these files as they are planned
for removal.


Reference implementation
========================

The rospkg [3]_ library has been updated to support these environment
variables.  The ``rosversion`` script has also been moved to rospkg.

The specific API additions include:

 * ``rospkg.get_etc_ros_dir()``
 * ``rospkg.distro.current_distro_codename()``
