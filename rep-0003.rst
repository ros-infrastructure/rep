Abstract
========

This REP defines target platforms for each ROS Distribution Release.
We define platforms to include both operating system releases (e.g. Ubuntu
Trusty (14.04 LTS)) as well as major language releases (e.g. Python 2.7). The
target platforms represent the set on which all core stacks are
expected to work. Exceptions can be made for stacks that are
intentionally platform-specific.

Platforms by Distribution

If planned support for a target platform is changed, notice will be
sent to ros-developers to enable discussion of this issue.

Motivation
==========

This document is provided to help plan future development for
libraries. The primary platforms for ROS are Canonical's Ubuntu
releases, and our intent is to track these releases as best as
possible while also allowing for current, thirdparty libraries to be
used.

Rationale
=========

Target platforms for future releases are speculative and are based on
consulting Ubuntu's release and end-of-life schedule [1]_.

These targets, including starting and ending support dates, are based on the Distribution Timeline to meet minimum requirements. [3]_

Architectures
-------------

As of ROS Lunar, we do not build packages for i386 architectures. Released code is still expected to build on i386.
Ubuntu switched its default to 64bits and we noticed a significant decrease of
ROS package downloads for this architecture.

C++
---

The C++ code in ROS is meant to be compiler-agnostic.
While we mainly develop with gcc, no use of compiler-specific features is allowed without proper use of macros to allow use on other platforms or with other compilers.

Melodic
~~~~~~~
As of ROS Melodic, we are using the C++14 (ISO/IEC 14882:2014) standard.
All packages are free to use C++14 features in public and private APIs.
Before changing existing public APIs to use C++14 features, package maintainers should carefully consider whether the change is worth the breakage to downstream consumers of the API.
If at all possible, maintainers should use a "tick-tock" model where the new APIs are introduced alongside the old (deprecated) APIs, and then remove the old APIs in a subsequent release.

Lunar and earlier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As of ROS Jade, we are still using the C++03 (ISO/IEC 14882:2003) standard.

Use of C++11/C++14 features and filesystem/networking/etc... TS's (Technical Specifications) is allowed if they are checked for at configure time and equivalent functionality can be provided without the extra compiler features.
Support for C++11 is now a compiler requirement, but the API of the packages included in desktop-full will not use any C++11-specific feature. External packages are encouraged to follow this guideline.

For a given release we allow use of Boost libraries that match the version provided in our
low-water-mark Ubuntu version.

Lisp
----

We use Steel Bank Common Lisp as our ANSI Common Lisp
implementation. We are currently tracking SBCL 1.0.38 and will track
future updates in the 1.0.x series as appropriate.

Python
------

Our intent with Python is to track the minimum version provided in the
supported Ubuntu platforms, as well as survey other commonly used OS
platforms that support ROS to determine a reasonable minimum target.

Melodic
~~~~~~~
Ubuntu will most likely stop supporting Python 2 in release 20.04.
To make sure ROS will be able to support that version of Ubuntu, ROS Python packages starting with Melodic Morenia are highly encouraged to support both Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 or later.
During the development of Melodic there will be work undertaken to support both Python 2 and Python 3 (including rosdep keys) so ROS package developers can more easily test with either version of Python.

Lunar and earlier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ubuntu has announced plans to release 14.04 in April 2014 with Python
3 as its default interpreter. Some ROS infrastructure and core scripts
already work with Python 3 since Groovy. But, it remains difficult to
set up a test environment so ROS package developers can also port to
Python 3.

The preferred migration strategy is to support both Python 2.7 and
Python >= 3.2 in each source script. Supporting any version earlier
than 2.6 makes that task harder. Python 3.0 and 3.1 will probably
never be supported explicitly, although some things may work.

catkin / rosbuild support
=========================

catkin was officially introduced in Groovy beside rosbuild.

Since even half a year after the Hydro release not a single rosbuild-based
package was released the support for building Debian packages of rosbuild-based
packages has been discontinued in Hydro.

As of Indigo the ROS build farm also only supports documenting and continuous
integration testing of catkin-based packages.
Since Indigo is a LTS release and aims to be supported for several years
maintaining the legacy code for rosbuild-based packages seems to be
impractical.

rosbuild-based packages can still be built from source (which should also be
supported in upcoming ROS distributions).

Core Stacks
===========

Core stacks are required to comply with the target platforms listed
here, though exceptions can be granted for core stacks that are
inherently platform-specific.  The set of core stacks is currently
defined by variants included with each ROS distribution release.

C Turtle
--------

This REP applies to stacks in the `base` variant for C Turtle.

Diamondback
-----------

This REP applies to stacks in the `desktop-extras` variant [2]_ for Diamondback.

Non-core Stacks
===============

And thirdly, the code is more what you'd call "guidelines" than actual rules...

We hope that ROS stack maintainers will make every effort to comply
with the target platforms within this REP, but we recognize that ROS
stacks represent a spectrum of development, from research prototypes
to hardened libraries.  There are also cases where supporting target
platforms may incur unnecessary effort, such as a set of drivers for a
specific robot platform.
