Abstract
========

This REP provides a reference for the units and coordinate conventions
used within ROS.


Rationale
=========

Inconsistency in units and conventions is a common source of
integration issues for developers and can also lead to software
bugs. It can also create unnecessary computation due to data
conversion. This REP documents the standard conventions for ROS in
order to lessen these issues.

Exceptions
==========

The scope of potential robotics software is too broad to require all
ROS software to follow the guidelines of this REP.  However, choosing different
conventions should be well justified and well documented.

For example, there are domains where the default conventions are not
appropriate. Interstellar lengths are not appropriately measured in
meters, and space-oriented libraries may wish to choose a different
convention. There are other exceptions that different domains may wish
to address.

Units
=====

We have chosen to standardize on SI units.  These units are the most
consistent international standard. SI units are maintained by Bureau
International des Poids et Mesures. [1]_ There is good documentation
on Wikipedia for `International System Of Units`_

.. _International System of Units: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units

Base Units
----------
These are the base units which are commonly used

========  ========
Quantity  Unit
========  ========
length    meter
mass      kilogram
time      second
current   ampere
========  ========

Derived Units
-------------

SI defines seven base units and many derived units.  If you are not using
SI base units, you should use SI-derived units.

Good documentation can be found on Wikipedia about `SI derived units`_

Commonly used SI-derived units in ROS are:

===========   =======
Quantity      Unit
===========   =======
angle         radian
frequency     hertz
force         newton
power         watt
voltage       volt
temperature   celsius
magnetism     tesla

Coordinate Frame Conventions
============================

All coordinate frames should follow these conventions.  

Chirality
---------

All systems are right handed.  This means they comply with the `right hand rule`_.

.. _right hand rule: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule


Axis Orientation
----------------

In relation to a body the standard is:

* x forward
* y left
* z up

For short-range Cartesian representations of geographic locations, use the
`east north up`_ (ENU) convention:

* X east
* Y north
* Z up

To avoid precision problems with large float32 values, it is recommended to
choose a nearby origin such as your system's starting position.

Suffix Frames
-------------

In the case of cameras, there is often a second frame defined with a
"_optical" suffix. This uses a slightly different convention:

* z forward
* x right
* y down

For outdoor systems where it is desirable to work under the
`north east down`_ (NED) convention, define an appropriately transformed
secondary frame with the "_ned" suffix:

* X north
* Y east
* Z down

Rotation Representation
-----------------------

There are many ways to represent rotations. The preferred order is listed below, along with rationale.

1. quaternion

  * Compact representation
  * No singularities

2. rotation matrix

  * No singularities

3. fixed axis roll, pitch, yaw about X, Y, Z axes respectively

  * No ambiguity on order
  * Used for angular velocities

4. euler angles yaw, pitch, and roll about Z, Y, X axes respectively

  * Euler angles are generally discouraged due to having 24 'valid'
    conventions with different domains using different conventions by
    default.  

By the right hand rule, the yaw component of orientation increases as the child frame
rotates counter-clockwise.
For geographic poses, yaw is zero when pointing east, and is thus 90 degrees when the 
vehicle is facing north.

This requires special mention only because it differs from a traditional `compass bearing`_,
which is zero when pointing north and increments clockwise. Hardware drivers should make
the appropriate transformations before publishing standard ROS messages.

Covariance Representation
-------------------------
Linear
::

    float64[9] linear_acceleration_covariance # 3x3 row major matrix in x, y, z order

Angular

::

    float64[9] angular_velocity_covariance # 3x3 row major matrix about x, y, z order with fixed axes

Six Dimensional

::

    # Row-major representation of the 6x6 covariance matrix
    # The orientation parameters use a fixed-axis representation.
    # In order, the parameters are:
    # (x, y, z, rotation about X axis, rotation about Y axis, rotation about Z axis)
    float64[36] covariance
