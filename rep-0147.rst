Abstract
========

This REP is written to provide a common interface for aerial vehicles.
This interface is designed to promote interoperability and reusability of core functionality between diverse aerial vehicles.
By leveraging the interfaces defined in this REP we both tools and libraries can be designed to be reusable between different frameworks and vehicles.
It is expected that aerial vehicles can and will implement additional interfaces in addition to these core interfaces.
When choosing an interface these should be considered the default and only change away from them for a good reason.

These interfaces are designed to be relevant for all types of aerial vehicles whether multi-copter, fixed-wing, hybrid, transitional or other.
Like ground robots, the core abstraction is the same for all vehicles regardless of their method of motivation.

Rationale
=========

There are a lot of developers around the world using ROS on aerial vehicles.
As such there are also many different implementations which are similiar but not exactly compatible.
A short list of existing known bridges and implementations follows: 

 - astec_mav_framework [#astec]_
 - autopilot_bridge [#autopilot_bridge]_
 - CRATES [#crates]_
 - dji_sdk_dji2ros [#djisdk]_
 - hector_quadrotor [#hector]_
 - mav_tools [#mav_tools]_
 - mavlink2ros [#mavlink2ros]_
 - mavros [#mavros]_
 - roscopter [#roscopter]_
 - rospilot [#rospilot]_

Due to a lack of common interfaces the majority of the above packages cannot be used together.
By implementing common interfaces elements of each package can be used in conjunction with elements of a different package.
This will allow much better collaboration between projects and allow a reduction in duplicate efforts to implement the same functionality.

There are also a lot of interfaces already well developed from other domains which can be brought into the aerial vehicle domain.
This REP seeks to also integrate as many of those reusable interfaces as well to provide the greatest compatibilty with those other domains.

Other interface defintions
==========================

There are a lot of messages already defined.
These messages definitions were used to help define this set. 

 - DroneKit [#dronekit]_
 - mav_msgs [#mav_msgs]_
 - mavlink [#mavlink]_
 - mavlink2 [#mavlink2]_
 - mavros_msgs [#mavros]_
 - nav_msgs [#nav_msgs]_
 - trajectory_msgs [#trajectory_msgs]_



Reference Abstractions
======================

For this document we will use the following abstractions of the architecture.
These abstractions are used to define the interfaces, however it is not required that a given system implement all the interfaces.
A given system may implement subsets of these interfaces.


Control Abstractions
--------------------

For controlling an aerial vehicle we will use the following terms for the interfaces.

.. raw:: html
  
  <div class="mermaid">

High Level Architecture

  </div>


Coordinate Frames
=================

It is expected that users of this interface will also follow the coordinate frame conventions layed out in REP 105 [#rep105]_.

Proposed Interfaces
===================

Control Interfaces
------------------

Trajectory Control Interface
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For sending trajectories in 3D space there already exists a message used for free space planning.
This message used is ``trajectory_msgs/MultiDOFJointTrajectory`` [#multidoftraj]_ and is actively used by planning frameworks already.

This message is not the most straight forward to parse as it has a lot of optional fields which increases the complexity and requires consistent labelling and filling.
The complexity of the message parsing is traded off against supporting a relatively compact representations.

* Datatype: ``trajectory_msgs/MultiDOFJointTrajectory`` [#multidoftraj]_ 
* Topic: ``command_trajectory``

::

  # The header is used to specify the coordinate frame and the reference time for the trajectory durations
  Header header

  # A representation of a multi-dof joint trajectory (each point is a transformation)
  # Each point along the trajectory will include an array of positions/velocities/accelerations
  # that has the same length as the array of joint names, and has the same order of joints as
  # the joint names array.

  string[] joint_names
  MultiDOFJointTrajectoryPoint[] points

Pose Interface
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The message to send a goal pose is ``geometry_msgs/PoseStamped`` [#posestamped]_.
This is a very highly used standard message and contains precisely the information needed.

* Datatype: ``geometry_msgs/PoseStamped`` [#posestamped]_
* Topic: ``command_pose``

::

  # A Pose with reference coordinate frame and timestamp
  Header header
  Pose pose

The reference position is the origin of the ``base_link`` as defined in [#REP105]_

Rate Interface
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The messge to send a velocity command is ``geometry_msgs/TwistStamped`` [#twiststamped]_.
This is the standard way to command ROS vehicles.
The datatype is not timestamped or externally referenced as it is not intended to be used in an open loop control system.

* Datatype: ``geometry_msgs/TwistStamped`` [#twiststamped]_
* Topic: ``command_velocity``

::

    std_msgs/Header header
      uint32 seq
      time stamp
      string frame_id
    geometry_msgs/Twist twist
      geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
        float64 x
        float64 y
        float64 z
      geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular
        float64 x
        float64 y
        float64 z

The command is a body relative set of accelerations in linear and angular space.
This diverges from the common ``geometry_msgs/Twist`` [#twist]_ used by ground robots.
A pure ``Twist`` based inteface could be provided for backwards compatability as well.
It was chosen to diverge here since this is a much more powerful inteface for the vehicles and does not require all commands to be reverse calculated for the instantaneous attitude of the vehicle.

.. TODO remove after review
.. The Rate interface can be implemented by two messages.
..
.. The messages are ``mav_msgs/AttitudeThrust`` [#attitudethrust]_ and ``mav_msgs/RollPitchYawrateThrust`` [#rpythrust]_.
.. These are both well established messages which have evolved from usage.
.. They are well established and have several existing implementations.
.. The ``mav_msgs/RollPitchYawrateThrust`` is a convenience message to support low level controllers that are not aware of the absolute yaw.
..
.. They diverge from the common ``geometry_msgs/Twist`` [#twiststamped]_ used by ground robots.
.. A ``Twist`` based inteface could be provided for backwards compatability as well.
.. It was chosen do diverge here since this is a much more natural interface for aerial vehicles.
..

..                                  # Set all un-used components to 0.
..
..
.. Implementations of this interface should accept messages on either topic/datatype.
.. Publishers are expected to choose only one.

Acceleration Interface
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,


The messge to send a velocity command is ``geometry_msgs/Twist`` [#twiststamped]_.
The datatype is not timestamped or externally referenced as it is not intended to be used in an open loop control system.

* Datatype: ``geometry_msgs/TwistStamped`` [#twiststamped]_
* Topic: ``command_acceleration``

::

    std_msgs/Header header
      uint32 seq
      time stamp
      string frame_id
    geometry_msgs/Twist twist
      geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear
        float64 x
        float64 y
        float64 z
      geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular
        float64 x
        float64 y
        float64 z



The command is a body relative set of accelerations in linear and angular space.
The reference position is the origin of the ``base_link`` as defined in [#REP105]_


.. TODO remove after review
.. The acceleartion interface is implemented using the established ``mav_msgs/RateThrust`` [#ratethrust]_ message.
.. This message is very similar to the standard ``Twist`` message however it removes some of the ambiguities of the reference frame by explicitly referencing the body frame.
..
.. * Datatype: ``mav_msgs/RateThrust``  [#ratethrust]_
.. * Topic: ``command_acceleration``
..
.. ::
..
..   Header header
..
..   # We use the coordinate frames with the following convention:
..   #   x: forward
..   #   y: left
..   #   z: up
..
..   geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular_rates  # Roll-, pitch-, yaw-rate around body axes [rad/s]
..   geometry_msgs/Vector3 thrust         # Thrust [N] expressed in the body frame.
..                                        # For a fixed-wing, usually the x-component is used.
..                                        # For a multi-rotor, usually the z-component is used.
..                                        # Set all un-used components to 0.


High Level Interfaces
---------------------

Odometry Interface
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To communicate odometry information the ``nav_msgs/Odometry`` message will be used. [#odometry]_
This is the standard message used throughout ROS systems already, many modules already take advantage of it.
However there are many use cases for aerial vehicles when the estimation of the acceleration is important.
So an additional message will be defined which provides acceleration in addition to position and velocity already defined.
This additional message will be published in parallel.
For backwards compatibility all systems will publish both.

* Datatype: ``nav_msgs/Odometry`` [#odometry]_
* Topic: ``odom``

::

  # This represents an estimate of a position and velocity in free space.
  # The pose in this message should be specified in the coordinate frame given by header.frame_id.
  # The twist in this message should be specified in the coordinate frame given by the child_frame_id
  Header header
  string child_frame_id
  geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance pose
  geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovariance twist

* Datatype: ``nav_msgs/OdometryWithAcceleration`` `[proposed]`
* Topic: ``odometry``

::

  # This represents an estimate of a position, velocity, and acceleration in free space.
  # The pose in this message should be specified in the coordinate frame given by header.frame_id.
  # The twist and acceleration in this message should be specified in the coordinate frame given by the child_frame_id
  Header header
  string child_frame_id
  geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance pose
  geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovariance twist
  geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovariance acceleration


Goal Interface
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is expected that there will be several high level ways to communicate goals which are application specific.

TODO(tfoote): Maybe add a standard GPS waypoint list here? Things already in mavlink?

Currently Unspecified
---------------------

Obstacle Observations
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The obstacle observations are expected to use common sensor messages.
However since there are a large variety of potential sensors, this interface will not be defined in this REP.
It is recommended to use the common messages such as ``LaserScan``, ``DepthImage``, and ``PointCloud2`` from ``sensor_msgs`` whenever possible. [#sensormsgs]_

Shared State
,,,,,,,,,,,,

The shared state between the collision mapping and motion planning controller is expected to be very specific to the implementation.
As such it is not proposed to be standardized.

Other Interfaces
================

Battery State
-------------
Aerial vehicles should use the ``sensor_msgs/BatteryState`` message for reporting their battery status. [#batterystate]_
This is a recently standardized message which is much more broadly applicable than aerial vehicles and has already been standardized.

* Datatype: ``sensor_msgs/BatteryState`` [#batterystate]_
* Topic: ``battery_state``
