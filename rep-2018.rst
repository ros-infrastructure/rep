Abstract
========

This REP proposes a feature to introspect ROS actions during runtime.
The feature allows users to remotely monitor action communication and enables ``rosbag2`` to record/replay the action messages.

Motivation
==========

There are 2 primary motivation for this proposal.

- To make it easier for users to externally validate that actions are operating as expected.
- To enhance ``rosbag2`` debug capability to record, display and play action messages and services. 

Drawing an analogy to ROS topics and services, there exist tools and libraries for "echoing" and recording messages sent over a topic, and this REP proposes the same kind of capabilities for actions.

Specifically, the capability to introspect action topic messages and service requests/responses that are sent to and from action servers and clients.
Being able to remotely monitor actions allows users to more effectively troubleshoot issues in a ROS system.
For example, users can monitor the action feedback and status, verify requests are being sent and received by an action client and server during runtime.
In addition to introspection, user can record and replay action messages and service requests/responses to validate their content later on.

This REP targets to complete core feature ``Action Introspection`` and ``rosbag2`` command line interface to record and play the action messages and services from the bag file.


Specification
=============

Subscribe Hidden Topics
-----------------------

As described in `ROS 2 Action Design <https://design.ros2.org/articles/actions.html>`_, ROS 2 actin creates 2 topics for a single action.
There are ``status`` and ``feedback`` topics that are hidden, usually user cannot see those topics but it can take advantage of these hidden topics.

  .. code-block::

    $ ros2 topic list --include-hidden-topics
    /fibonacci/_action/feedback
    /fibonacci/_action/status

It can subscribe these ``status`` and ``feedback`` hidden topics to get the messages between action server and clients.

Publishing Service Events from Action
-------------------------------------

ROS 2 action also creates 3 services for a single action.
There are ``send_goal``, ``cancel_goal`` and ``get_result`` hidden services, user cannot see those hidden services but it can also take advantage of these hidden services.

  .. code-block::

    $ ros2 service list --include-hidden-services
    /fibonacci/_action/cancel_goal
    /fibonacci/_action/get_result
    /fibonacci/_action/send_goal

It can enable `Service Introspection <https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/360>` _ for those hidden services, so that those services publish service event messages to the hidden topic ``/ACTION_NAME//SERVICE_NAME/_service_event``, where ``ACTION_NAME`` and ``SERVICE_NAME`` are the fully-qualified name of the service.

Service Event Code Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ROS 2 action is composed of topics and services, those message and service types are auto-generated from ``.action`` file.
To publish service events for each service, service event message types need to be extended with ``ServiceEventInfo.msg`` as designed by `Service Introspection <https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/360>` _.

During `Service Introspection <https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/360>` _ development, `Generate Service Event Messages <https://github.com/ros2/rosidl/pull/700>` _ extends rosidl code generation that includes ``.action`` files.
So service event messages for actions can be already supported.

Enable Action Introspection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``Action Introspection`` should be configured and enabled by user application to action server and client.

The API will allow user application to:

- Disable ``Action Introspection`` completely, that disables service introspection under this action accordingly.
- Enable the sending of only metadata to service events
- Enable the sending of metadata and service contents to service events

By default, the service event publishing feature is off for all action clients and all servers so users do not pay for a feature they do not plan to use.
Furthermore, node authors may opt-in by default or disable the ``Action Introspection`` feature altogether as they see fit.

Global Unique Identification
----------------------------

ROS action servers likely have multiple clients, and multiple goals can be processed concurrently with multiple executor threads.
This means that ``Action Introspection`` messages and service events must be identified by global unique identification, otherwise it cannot distinguish ``Action Introspection`` messages or service events from multiple action clients or goals.

In ROS action, there is goal identification called ``Goal ID`` (Universally Unique Identifier) for each goal generated by action client.
Besides, `Service Introspection <https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/360>` integrates service client unique identification and sequence number in each service event messages.
With these identification, it can tell the messages and service events belong to which action clients and goals.

We can confirm that ``Goal ID`` is already implemented in ``status`` and ``feedback`` hidden topics.

  .. code-block::

    $ ros2 topic echo /fibonacci/_action/status --flow-style
    status_list: [{goal_info: {goal_id: {uuid: [167, 14, 74, 213, 14, 241, 184, 187, 149, 34, 75, 132, 131, 137, 240, 15]}, stamp: {sec: 1714523443, nanosec: 875421940}}, status: 4}, {goal_info: {goal_id: {uuid: [59, 26, 199, 67, 217, 28, 132, 19, 148, 141, 105, 10, 13, 6, 56, 38]}, stamp: {sec: 1714523453, nanosec: 719698899}}, status: 2}]

    $ ros2 topic echo /fibonacci/_action/feedback --flow-style
    goal_id:
      uuid: [31, 144, 125, 69, 26, 78, 96, 190, 125, 26, 24, 44, 222, 174, 204, 97]
    feedback:
      partial_sequence: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

For service events from action, it expects the following information as an example of ``send_goal`` service event.

  .. code-block::

    $ ros2 service echo /fibonacci/_action/send_goal
    info:
      event_type: REQUEST_RECEIVED

Command Line Interfaces
-----------------------

``ros2 action echo``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The existing ``ros2 action`` command line tool will be extended with an ``echo`` sub-command to print the action communication.
This internally subscribes 2 hidden topic (``feedback`` and ``status``) and 3 service event topics (``send_goal``, ``cancel_goal`` and ``get_result`` services) in default to print them.

An example ``ros2 action echo`` call may look like the following:

.. code-block::

  $ ros2 action echo /fibonnaci

  request:
    goal_id: 12.34.56.78.90.ab.cd.ef.fe.dc.ba.09.87.65.43.21

    goals_canceling: 12.34.56.78.90.ab.cd.ef.fe.dc.ba.09.87.65.43.21
  -----------------------

There should be optional arguments to monitor the specific interface types.
This option can be useful to exclude interfaces in the action, so that user can monitor what only needs to be checked.

  $ ros2 action echo /fibonnaci --interfaces "FEEDBACK_TOPIC,RESULT_SERVICE"
  -----------------------
  interface: FEEDBACK_TOPIC
  stamp:
    sec: 1234
    nanosec: 000000000

  -----------------------


``ros2 bag record <action>``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The existing tool `rosbag2 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2>`_ can be also extended with ``Action Introspection`` to record the action communication data into bag files.

  .. code-block::

    $ ros2 bag record --actions <action_names>

This can record the action communication in the bag file aligned with topics and services.

Recorded action data can be printed like following.

  .. code-block::

    $ ros2 bag ros2 bag info <bag_folder_name> -v

    Files:             <bag_name>.mcap
    Bag size:          39.9 KiB
    Storage id:        mcap

``ros2 bag play <action>``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`rosbag2 <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2>`_ can also provide the capability to replay action data from the bag file, which is similar with `rosbag2 replay service <https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/blob/rolling/docs/design/rosbag2_record_replay_service.md>`_.
This is useful to simulate the action client behavior from the stored bag file, that can allow users to debug and monitor the action servers.

For being able to play the data as action client, it needs to introduce the new class like ``GenericActionClient`` similar with `GenericClient <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/blob/rolling/rclcpp/include/rclcpp/generic_client.hpp>`_.
``rosbag2`` internally creates generic action client to deduce the action type from the bag file, and then sends the action requests to the action servers.


Feature Progress
================

Most elements of this proposal have been verified with PoC codes.

Progress on the implementation is being tracked on GitHub at `ros2/ros2#1543 <https://github.com/ros2/ros2/issues/1543>`_.


Possible Future Enhancement
===========================

``Action Introspection`` brings user to be able to see action communication using command line tools or recorded data.
This will be useful for user especially debugging and collecting data at runtime environment without inserting debuging code.

On the other hand, it would be complicated to monitor ``Service Introspection`` and ``Action Introspection`` information with using ``ros2 action echo``, ``ros2 service echo`` and ``ros2 bag info`` command line interfaces. 
It would be really helpful to have GUI base tool to see those data at runtime or from bag file, so that users can determine communication among services and actions with a brief look.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

The addition of ``Action Introspection`` and ``rosbag2 action support`` should not impact existing logic.
As an opt-in feature, users should not incur additional overhead by default.
