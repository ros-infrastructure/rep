Abstract
========

This REP proposes two updates to rosinstall: ``roslocate`` and
``rosco``.  ``roslocate`` enables users to locate rosinstall fragments
and other information about ROS stacks and packages. ``rosco``
supports source-control checkout of any rosinstall fragment.


Motivation
==========

rosco
-----

``rosinstall`` [1]_ is a useful tool for managing a consistent
development tree of multiple ROS stacks.  It takes care of important
environment configuration, tree updates, and more.  It is less useful
in situations where you just want to quickly get the source for a
particular stack or package as it does more than just retrieve code.

For example, you want to add a stack to an existing checkout, you may have to:

1. Lookup the rosinstall fragment for the package/stack using ``roslocate``.
2. Update your rosinstall configuration with this information.
3. Run rosinstall, which will iterate through all entries in the rosinstall file.

If you have multiple entries in the rosinstall file, you will have to
wait as rosinstall examines each for updates.

``rosco`` is instead motivated by "give me the source, now." In
exchange for this haste, it does not do any bookkeeping or environment
configuration for you: it is tries to be equivalent to running ``svn
co``, ``git clone``, or the like.

roslocate
---------

``roslocate`` is a tool for finding version-control and other
information about a ROS package or stack.  It is a command-line
interface for accessing information produced by the ROS indexing
system.

``roslocate`` has existed for quite some time in ROS, though its
current incarnation is fairly recent.  A new prototype was written in
December 2010 to emit rosinstall fragments as the original version was
SVN-centric.  The prototype was later included with ``rosinstall`` to
test its usefulness.

An updated version of this prototype was introduced on
``ros-developers`` in July 2011 to add distribution-specific searches
for its commands (``--dev``, ``--distro``).  ``roslocate`` has existed
as part of ``rosinstall`` for awhile, though it has not been formally
specified.  As there are now tools like ``rosco`` and ``rosws`` [3]_
that depend on this API, it is more important to provide this
specification.


Specification
=============


roslocate API
-------------

``roslocate`` has a command-based API.  Each of the commands is described below.


describe
''''''''

``roslocate describe`` summarizes information about a ROS package or
stack.  

Example::

    $ roslocate describe rosinstall
    
    Type: package
    Stack: ros_release
    Description: rosinstall is a tool to check out ROS source code (or any source code, really) from multiple version control repositories and updating these checkouts. Given a *.rosinstall file that specifies where to get code, rosinstall will check out a working copy for you. We recommend the use of rosinstall when checking out development versions of ROS source code. This package is where the code lives, however it is not expected for users to checkout and use this package directly.  It is expected that users use the version available through pypi.python.org.
    URL: http://ros.org/wiki/rosinstall
        
info
''''

Prints the rosinstall fragment for the resource.  

Example::

    $ roslocate info common
    - hg:
        local-name: common
        meta:
          repo-name: wg-kforge
        uri: https://kforge.ros.org/common/common
        version: default
    

repo
''''

Prints the name of the repository the resource is stored in.  This
repository name is for display purposes only -- it cannot be used as
input to source control tools.

Example::

    $ roslocate repo cram_pl
    tum-ros-pkg

uri
'''

Prints the source control URI of a resource.  This is mainly intended
as input to other programs via shell backtick or pipe.


Example::

    $ roslocate uri rospy
    https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros_comm/trunk/clients/rospy


vcs
'''

Prints the type of version control system used for the resource.
Possible values include ``svn``, ``hg``, ``git``, and ``bzr``.


Example::

    $ roslocate vcs common
    hg

www
'''

Prints the website of a resource.  

Example::

    $ roslocate www rospy
    http://ros.org/wiki/rospy


--distro=DISTRO_NAME
''''''''''''''''''''

If the ``--distro=DISTRO_NAME`` option is combined with a roslocate
command, the information returned will be based on a particular
distribution release of a resource.


Example::

    $ roslocate info rospy
    - svn:
        local-name: rospy
        uri: https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros_comm/trunk/clients/rospy
    
    $ roslocate info rospy --distro=diamondback
    - svn:
        local-name: ros_comm
        uri: https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros_comm/tags/ros_comm-1.4.7
    

--dev
'''''

If the ``--dev`` option is combined with a roslocate command, the
information returned will be based on the development branch of the
resource (e.g. ``trunk``), if possible.  It should be used in
combination with the ``--distro=DISTRO_NAME`` option as development
trees are indexed based on a particular ROS distribution.

The ``-dev`` option generally only affects source control information,
like URIs and rosinstall fragments.  Other information, like resource
descriptions, are not guaranteed to be development-branch specific.

    
Example::

    $ roslocate info rospy --distro=electric
    - svn:
        local-name: ros_comm
        uri: https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros_comm/tags/ros_comm-1.6.0
        
    $ roslocate info rospy --distro=electric --dev
    - svn:
        local-name: ros_comm
        uri: https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros_comm/trunk
    


rosco command-line API
----------------------

The ``rosco`` command is roughly equivalent to running the equivalent
``svn``, ``git``, or other source control tool to "checkout" or
"clone" a repository.  It does not record any additional state.


rosco <package-or-stack>
''''''''''''''''''''''''

Searches for the specified ROS package or stack and retrieves the
source code use the appropriate version control tool.  For example, if
the source code is stored in a Subversion repository, ``rosco`` will
run a ``svn checkout`` of the resource in the local directory.


rosco --rosinstall <rosinstall-file>, rosco -r <rosinstall-file>
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

For each entry in the rosinstall file, retrieve the source code use
the appropriate version control tool.  Unlike ``rosinstall``, it only
retrieves the source code and nothing more.


piped input
'''''''''''

``rosco`` also accepts piped input formatted as rosinstall fragments.
This is primarily meant to be used in combination with ``roslocate``.

Example::

    $ roslocate info rospy | rosco


--distro=DISTRO_NAME
''''''''''''''''''''

Checkout the source code for a particular ROS distribution release,
e.g. ``rosco rospy --distro=electric`` will checkout the Electric
release of rospy.  This option is not valid when used with ``--rosinstall``.
    

--dev
'''''

The ``--dev`` option causes ``rosco`` to checkout the development
branch instead.  It should be specified in combination with a
``--distro=DISTRO_NAME`` option as development branches are
distribution specific.


Packaging
---------

``rosco`` and ``roslocate`` are distributed as scripts with the
rosinstall PyPI package.


Rationale
=========


rosco API
---------

The original ``rosco`` prototype had a different command-line specification::

    rosco <rosinstall-file>


This style favored rosinstall fragments for the API.  The revised API
is based on discussions with Ibrahim Awwal on ros-users.  Ibrahim
wrote a different ``rosco`` prototype that favored package and stack
names as the primary argument.  This syntax is more direct as it omits
the intermediate step of having to run the ``roslocate`` tool to
generate the rosinstall data.


--dev
-----

Both ``roslocate`` and ``rosco`` return the released version of a
stack by default.  Thus, by default, users will get a working code
tree.  There is also no option to select between the version-based tag
and a distribution-based tag of a resource: the version-based tag is
always used.  This simplifies the command-line API as users don't have
to distinguish between these two different types of tags.  Although
tracking tags, e.g. distribution-based tags, are useful, they
encounter issues on VCS tools like ``git`` and we may phase them out
in the future.


Compatibility
=============

Removal of ``roslocate rosinstall``
-----------------------------------

This REP removes the ``roslocate rosinstall`` command that was part of
the prototype tool.  Originally, ``roslocate`` had separate
``rosinstall`` and ``info`` subcommands.  The ``rosinstall`` command
was meant to return the exact rosinstall fragment used to generate the
index information, whereas ``info`` was meant to provide more advanced
URL computations, like returning the URL of a specific package inside
a stack.  The distinction between these two was confusing and
dependent on the implementation of the indexer.


rosco
-----

The new ``rosco`` API is not compatible with the original prototype.
As the original prototype had limited visiblity, this is assumed to
not be a major issue.
