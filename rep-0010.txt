Abstract
========

This REP outlines the ros-developers voting guidelines.  These
guidelines serve to provide feedback or gauge the "wind direction" on
a particular proposal, idea, or feature.  They don't have a binding
force.

REP 10 is a direct copy of PEP 10 [1]_ by Barry Warsaw. The Author
field of this document has been updated to reflect responsiblity for
maintenance.

Rationale
=========

When a new idea, feature, patch, etc. is floated in the Python
community, either through a REP or on the mailing lists (most likely
on ros-developers), it is sometimes helpful to gauge the community's
general sentiment.  Sometimes people just want to register their
opinion of an idea.  Sometimes the ROS Developers like to perform
simple arithmetic operations. Whatever the reason, these guidelines
have been adopted so as to provide a common language for developers.

While opinions are (sometimes) useful, but they are never binding.
Opinions that are accompanied by rationales are always valued higher
than bare scores (this is especially true with -1 votes).


Voting Scores
=============

There are 4 possible vote scores::

    +1 I like it

    +0 I don't care, but go ahead

    -0 I don't care, so why bother?

    -1 I hate it

You may occasionally see wild flashes of enthusiasm (either for or
against) with vote scores like +2, +1000, or -1000.  These aren't
really valued much beyond the above scores, but it's nice to see
people get excited about such geeky stuff.
