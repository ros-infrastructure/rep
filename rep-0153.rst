Abstract
========
This REP updates the specification of the ROS distribution files facilitated in
the building, packaging, testing and documenting process.

The intention is to annotate a ROS distribution with more information,
such as whether the distribution should use ROS 1 or ROS 2 semantics,
to avoid the need to externally define and update these metadata.

This REP is an extension to the file format defined in REP 143[1]_.
It currently does not repeat the content of REP 143 but only states the
differences.


Motivation
==========

For the following use cases additional metadata is currently necessary:

1. The ROS buildfarm has to distinguish ROS 1 distributions from ROS 2
   distributions because they require different dependencies to build a
   workspace.
   E.g. for ROS 1 workspaces ``catkin`` needs to be installed - even
   for plain CMake packages - since it provides the workspace level setup
   files.
   For ROS 2 the package ``ros_workspace`` is needed since it provides the
   setup files for the workspace and therefore the environment necessary to
   find resources.

2. The ROS wiki shows the list of currently active ROS distributions.
   Since the ``rosdistro`` contains all ROS distros - EOLed ones as well as
   upcoming distributions before their release date.

3. A ROS distribution uses either Python 2 or Python 3.
   When a package is bloomed the rosdep keys are mapped to Debian package
   names and depending on the targeted Python version the conditional
   dependencies need to be evaluated.

In all cases the missing metadata is currently being hard coded in the source
code and needs to be updated with every new ROS release.
Therefore this REP aims to add the necessary metadata about a ROS distribution
into the ``rosdistro`` instead.


Specification
=============

Index file
----------

* distributions

  * distribution:

    * distribution_status: an optional string describing the status of a ROS
      distribution.
      For the use case *2.* the semantic of the following values is defined:

      * ``prerelease``: An upcoming distribution which hasn't been released yet
      * ``active``: A distribution which has been released and is actively
        being supported
      * ``end-of-life``: A distribution which has reached its end of life

    * distribution_type: an optional string describing the type of the ROS
      distribution.
      For use case *1.* the values ``ros1`` and ``ros2`` will be used to
      distinguish the major ROS version.

    * python_version: an optional integer describing the major version of
      Python version of the ROS distribution.

    As of version 4 unknown keys should be ignored (instead of resulting in an
    error).
    This will allow future additions in a backward compatible way without the
    need to bump the version of the file.

* version: version number, this REP describes version 4 (instead of version 3
  described in REP 143 [1]_, version 2 described in REP 141 [2]_ and version 1
  described in REP 137 [3]_)


Reference implementation
------------------------
This REP is to be implemented in version 0.7 of the Python package *rosdistro*.
It will serve as a reference implementation for this REP.
A draft implementation can be found in [4]_.


Compatibility considerations
============================

The draft implementation of rosdistro is able to parse multiple index format
versions: 2, 3 as well as 4.

If the version of the existing ``index.yaml`` file would be bumped that would
require every user to update to the latest version of the Python package
``rosdistro``.
While generating some friction it is especially a problem on some systems (e.g.
Debian) which might not provide a newer version in stable distributions.

Therefore the existing index file isn't being changed but a sibling file named
``index-v4.yaml`` is being added.
The file has the same content except that is uses version 4 as specified in
this document and includes the additional metadata fields.

To make use of the new index file the new version of the Python package will
update the default URL to point to the v4 file.

``rosdistro`` version 0.7.5 or newer is necessary to access the
``python_version`` key.
Older versions of ``rosdistro`` will simply ignore the key in the yaml file and
not expose it through the API.

This provides a smooth transition for all users: users using the old version of
the Python package can continue to use it as is, users updating to the newer
version will benefit from the additional metadata.
Python code using the ``rosdistro`` API can easily check if the metadata is
present and if yes use it.
If desired other Python packages can explicily depend on the newer version to
ensure the v4 index is being used.

bloom
-----

Beside using the ``rosdistro`` API ``bloom`` also includes an explicit check
for the version of the index file [5]_.
Therefore a new patch release of ``bloom`` is required to also support the new
version 4 [6]_.
