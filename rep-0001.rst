What is a REP?
==============

REP stands for ROS Enhancement Proposal.  A REP is a design
document providing information to the ROS community, or describing
a new feature for ROS or its processes or environment.  The REP
should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a
rationale for the feature.

We intend REPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into ROS.  The REP
author is responsible for building consensus within the community and
documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the REPs are maintained as text files in a versioned
repository, their revision history is the historical record of the
feature proposal [1]_.

The REP process is based on the Python PEP process. We are thankful to
the Python PEP contributors for providing a process, tools, and
templates for community participation in a design process.

This initial document is based on a search-and-replace of PEP 1 by
Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, David Goodger. Over time, it will
incorporate ROS-specific changes to this process. The Author field of
this document has been changed in order to denote reponsibility for
maintenance, not credit for original authorship.


REP Types
=========

There are three kinds of REP:

1. A **Standards Track** REP describes a new feature or implementation
   for ROS.

2. An **Informational** REP describes a ROS design issue, or
   provides general guidelines or information to the ROS community,
   but does not propose a new feature.  Informational REPs do not
   necessarily represent a ROS community consensus or
   recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore
   Informational REPs or follow their advice.

3. A **Process** REP describes a process surrounding ROS, or
   proposes a change to (or an event in) a process.  Process REPs are
   like Standards Track REPs but apply to areas other than the ROS
   language itself.  They may propose an implementation, but not to
   ROS's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike
   Informational REPs, they are more than recommendations, and users
   are typically not free to ignore them.  Examples include
   procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and
   changes to the tools or environment used in ROS development.
   Any meta-REP is also considered a Process REP.


REP Work Flow
=============

The REP editors assign REP numbers and change their status.  Please post
all REP-related email to the General section of 
`discourse.ros.org <https://discourse.ros.org>`_. Also see `REP Editor
Responsibilities & Workflow`_ below.

The REP process begins with a new idea for ROS.  It is highly
recommended that a single REP contain a single key proposal or new
idea. Small enhancements or patches often don't need
a REP and can be injected into the ROS development work flow with a
patch submission to the REP `issue tracker`_. The more focussed the
REP, the more successful it tends to be.  The REP editor reserves the
right to reject REP proposals if they appear too unfocussed or too
broad.  If in doubt, split your REP into several well-focussed ones.

Each REP must have a champion -- someone who writes the REP using the
style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the
appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around
the idea.  The REP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to
ascertain whether the idea is REP-able.  Posting to 
`discourse.ros.org <https://discourse.ros.org>`_ is the best way to go
about this.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a REP is meant
to save the potential author time. Many ideas have been brought
forward for changing ROS that have been rejected for various
reasons. Asking the ROS community first if an idea is original
helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is
guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching
the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure
the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author.
Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not
mean it will work for most people in most areas where ROS is used.

Once the champion has asked the ROS community as to whether an idea
has any chance of acceptance, a draft REP should be posted to
`discourse.ros.org <https://discourse.ros.org>`_.  This gives the 
author a chance to flesh out the draft REP to make properly formatted,
of high quality, and to address initial concerns about the proposal.

Following an initial discussion on Discourse, the draft REP should be
posted to Discourse as well. The draft must be written in REP style as
described below, else it will be sent back without further regard
until proper formatting rules are followed.

If the REP editor approves, he will assign the REP a number, label it
as Standards Track, Informational, or Process, give it status "Draft",
and create and check-in the initial draft of the REP.  The REP editor
will not unreasonably deny a REP.  Reasons for denying REP status
include duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not
providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or
not in keeping with the ROS philosophy.  The MDFN (Malevolent Dictator
for Now, TBD) can be consulted during the approval phase, and is the
final arbiter of the draft's REP-ability.

As updates are necessary, the REP author can check in new versions if
they have GIT commit permissions, or can email new REP versions to
the REP editor for committing.

Standards Track REPs consist of two parts, a design document and a
reference implementation.  The REP should be reviewed and accepted
before a reference implementation is begun, unless a reference
implementation will aid people in studying the REP.  Standards Track
REPs must include an implementation -- in the form of code, a patch,
or a URL to same -- before it can be considered Final.

REP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on a REP
before submitting it for review. However, wherever possible, long
open-ended discussions on public mailing lists should be avoided.
Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include: setting up a
separate SIG mailing list for the topic, having the REP author accept
private comments in the early design phases, setting up a wiki page,
etc.  REP authors should use their discretion here.

Once the authors have completed a REP, they must inform the REP editor
that it is ready for review.  REPs are reviewed by the MDFN and his
chosen consultants, who may accept or reject a REP or send it back to
the author(s) for revision.  For a REP that is pre-determined to be
acceptable (e.g., it is an obvious win as-is and/or its implementation
has already been checked in) the MDFN may also initiate a REP review,
first notifying the REP author(s) and giving them a chance to make
revisions.

For a REP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria.  It
must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement.
The enhancement must represent a net improvement.  The proposed
implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate
existing libraries unduly.  Finally, a proposed enhancement must be
"ROSonic".  (However, "ROSonic" is an imprecise term; it may be
defined as whatever is acceptable to ROS Developers.  This logic is
intentionally circular.)

Once a REP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be
completed.  When the reference implementation is complete and accepted
by the MDFN, the status will be changed to "Final".

A REP can also be assigned status "Deferred".  The REP author or
editor can assign the REP this status when no progress is being made
on the REP.  Once a REP is deferred, the REP editor can re-assign it
to draft status.

A REP can also be "Rejected".  Perhaps after all is said and done it
was not a good idea.  It is still important to have a record of this
fact.

REPs can also be replaced by a different REP, rendering the original
obsolete.  This is intended for Informational REPs, where version 2 of
an API can replace version 1.

The possible paths of the status of REPs are as follows:

.. image:: rep-0001/rep-0001-1.png

Some Informational and Process REPs may also have a status of "Active"
if they are never meant to be completed.  E.g. REP 1 (this REP).


What belongs in a successful REP?
=================================

Each REP should have the following parts:

1. Preamble -- RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the
   REP, including the REP number, a short descriptive title (limited
   to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the
   contact info for each author, etc.

2. Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue
   being addressed.

3. Copyright/public domain -- Each REP must either be explicitly
   labelled as placed in the public domain (see this REP as an
   example) or licensed under the `Open Publication License`_.

4. Specification -- The technical specification should describe the
   syntax and semantics of any new feature.  The specification should
   be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable
   implementations for any of the current ROS client libraries, if
   applicable (roscpp, rospy, roslisp, etc...).

5. Motivation -- The motivation is critical for REPs that want to
   change the ROS APIs.  It should clearly explain why the existing
   API specification is inadequate to address the problem that
   the REP solves.  REP submissions without sufficient motivation may
   be rejected outright.

6. Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by
   describing what motivated the design and why particular design
   decisions were made.  It should describe alternate designs that
   were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported
   in other languages.

   The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the
   community and discuss important objections or concerns raised
   during discussion.

7. Backwards Compatibility -- All REPs that introduce backwards
   incompatibilities must include a section describing these
   incompatibilities and their severity.  The REP must explain how the
   author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.  REP
   submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise
   may be rejected outright.

8. Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be
   completed before any REP is given status "Final", but it need not
   be completed before the REP is accepted.  It is better to finish
   the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it
   before writing code.

   The final implementation must include test code and documentation.


REP Formats and Templates
=========================

All REP are expected to be formatted in reStructuredText_ with
UTF-8-encoding.  reStructuredText_ REPs allow for rich markup that is
still quite easy to read.  REP 12 contains instructions and a template
[2]_ for reStructuredText.

There is a Python script that converts REPs to HTML for viewing on the
web.  reStructuredText REPs are parsed and converted by Docutils_ code
called from the script.


REP Header Preamble
===================

Each REP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble.  The headers
must appear in the following order.  Headers marked with "*" are
optional and are described below.  All other headers are required. ::

    REP: <rep number>
    Title: <rep title>
    Version: <svn version string>
    Last-Modified: <svn date string>
    Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addrs>
  * Discussions-To: <email address>
    Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
             Withdrawn | Final | Replaced>
    Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
  * Content-Type: <text/plain | text/x-rst>
  * Requires: <rep numbers>
    Created: <date created on, in dd-mmm-yyyy format>
  * ROS-Version: <version number>
    Post-History: <dates of postings to discourse.ros.org>
  * Replaces: <rep number>
  * Replaced-By: <rep number>
  * Resolution: <url>

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses
of all the authors/owners of the REP.  The format of the Author header
value must be

    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>

if the email address is included, and just

    Random J. User

if the address is not given.  For historical reasons the format
"address@dom.ain (Random J. User)" may appear in a REP, however new
REPs must use the mandated format above, and it is acceptable to
change to this format when REPs are updated.

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line
following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.  Note that personal
email addresses in REPs will be obscured as a defense against spam
harvesters.

*Note: The Resolution header is required for Standards Track REPs
only.  It contains a URL that should point to an email message or
other web resource where the pronouncement about the REP is made.*

While a REP is in private discussions (usually during the initial
Draft phase), a Discussions-To header will indicate the mailing list
or URL where the REP is being discussed.  No Discussions-To header is
necessary if the REP is being discussed privately with the author.  
Note that email addresses in the Discussions-To header will not be 
obscured.

The Type header specifies the type of REP: Standards Track,
Informational, or Process.

The format of a REP is specified with a Content-Type header.  The only
supported values is "text/x-rst", which designates reStructuredText
encoding (see REP 12 [2]_).

The Created header records the date that the REP was assigned a
number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of when new
versions of the REP are posted to discourse.ros.org.  Both headers 
should be in dd-mmm-yyyy format, e.g. 14-Aug-2010.

Standards Track REPs must have a ROS-Version header which indicates
the version/distribution of ROS that the feature will be released with.
Informational and Process REPs do not need a ROS-Version header.

REPs may have a Requires header, indicating the REP numbers that this
REP depends on.

REPs may also have a Replaced-By header indicating that a REP has been
rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the
REP that replaces the current document.  The newer REP must have a
Replaces header containing the number of the REP that it rendered
obsolete.


Auxiliary Files
===============

REPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams.  Such files must be
named ``rep-XXXX-Y.ext``, where "XXXX" is the REP number, "Y" is a
serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual
file extension (e.g. "png").


Reporting REP Bugs, or Submitting REP Updates
=============================================

How you report a bug, or submit a REP update depends on several
factors, such as the maturity of the REP, the preferences of the REP
author, and the nature of your comments.  For the early draft stages
of the REP, it's probably best to send your comments and changes
directly to the REP author.  For more mature, or finished REPs you may
want to submit corrections to the REP `issue tracker`_ so that your
changes don't get lost.  If the REP author is a ROS developer, assign the
bug/patch to him, otherwise assign it to the REP editor.

When in doubt about where to send your changes, please check first
with the REP author and/or REP editor.

REP authors who are also ROS committers can update the
REPs themselves by using "git commit/push" to commit their changes.


Transferring REP Ownership
==========================

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of REPs to a
new champion.  In general, we'd like to retain the original author as
a co-author of the transferred REP, but that's really up to the
original author.  A good reason to transfer ownership is because the
original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or
following through with the REP process, or has fallen off the face of
the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email).  A bad
reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the
direction of the REP.  We try to build consensus around a REP, but if
that's not possible, you can always submit a competing REP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a REP, send a message
asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and
ros-users.  If the original author doesn't respond to email in a
timely manner, the REP editor will make a unilateral decision (it's
not like such decisions can't be reversed :).


REP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow
======================================

All REP-related correspondence should be sent (or CC'd) to
<ros-users@lists.ros.org>.

For each new REP that comes in an editor does the following:

* Read the REP to check if it is ready: sound and complete.  The ideas
  must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be
  accepted.

* The title should accurately describe the content.

* Edit the REP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure,
  etc.), markup (for reST REPs), code style (examples should match REP
  8 & 7).

If the REP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for
revision, with specific instructions.

Once the REP is ready for the repository, the REP editor will:

* Assign a REP number (almost always just the next available number,
  but sometimes it's a special/joke number, like 666 or 3141).

* List the REP in REP 0 (in two places: the categorized list, and the
  numeric list).

* Add the REP to GIT.

  The command to check out a read-only copy of the repository is::

      git clone https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep.git

* Send email back to the REP author with next steps (post to
  ros-users).

Updates to existing REPs also come in to ros-users@lists.ros.org.  Many
REP authors are not GIT committers yet, so we do the commits for them.

Many REPs are written and maintained by developers with write access
to the ROS codebase.  The REP editors monitor the rep-commits list for
REP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup
mistakes we see.

The editors don't pass judgement on REPs.  We merely do the
administrative & editorial part.  Except for times like this, there's
relatively low volume.
