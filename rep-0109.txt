Abstract
========

The definition of ROS stacks and packages is changed to enable a
directory to be both a stack and a package.  We call this combined
entity a *unary stack* to indicate that it is a stack with a single
package entity.

Motivation
==========

ROS enables developers to organize directories into both *packages*
and *stacks*.  Packages are the basic unit of the ROS build system and
they typically contain libraries, nodes, and configuration files.
Stacks are the basic unit of the ROS release system

Packages and stacks are usually organized at different levels of
granularity.  Packages are focused on build products and thus follow a
'Goldilocks' principle: enough functionality to be useful, not too
much to be heavyweight.  A package might provide an implementation of
a specific algorithm or data structure.

Stacks are focused on release products, so they usually organize
packages together that provide an aggregate functionality, like a
navigation system.  Stacks are also organized by software development
concerns: they often collect code that is co-developed and has
interdependent APIs.  Releasing this code together enables shared
internal APIs to be changed together within a single release.

While most stacks contain multiple packages, there are several
instances of stacks only containing a single package.  This type of
organization is common with external libraries that are integrated
into ROS and also common with packages that are developed in
isolation, such as a ROS client library.  For example, the
``slam_gmapping`` stack just contains the ``gmapping`` package.  This
demonstrates the awkward naming prefix that is often used to
differentiate the stack from the package.

There are also cases where stacks collect packages that either have
similar functionality or were co-developed, but are better provided
separately.  For example, the various driver stacks in ROS collect
similar drivers, like ``camera_drivers``, and ``laser_drivers``.  This
collection requires users to install many drivers, instead of drivers
just for the hardware they have.

One final interesting case is external libraries that wish to provide
ROS integration.  While these libraries can add a ROS package manifest
to their source tree to achieve integration with the build system,
they must create an additional level of directory hierarchy to be
release-able.

Unary stacks enable a filesystem directory to be treated as both a
package and stack.  This will alleviate pain felt by developers when
the package and stack organizational levels overlap and also make it
easier for external library maintainers to release code for use in a
ROS system.


Specification
=============

*Unary stacks* are defined to be directories that contain both a
*stack manifest* [1]_ and *package manifest* [2]_.  With respect to
ROS command-line tools, the directory is both a stack and a package.
The stack contains a single package, which shares the same name.

Stack version
-------------

The stack version number is currently contained the ``CMakeLists.txt``
file.  For example, this indicate a stack at version 1.2.5:

::

  rosbuild_make_distribution(1.2.5)


For backwards compatibility, we will continue to support the
``rosbuild_make_distribution()`` macro as a version number source.

In order to support external libraries that cannot use this CMake macro,
this REP introduces a ``<version>`` tag in the stack manifest:

::

   <stack>
      <version>1.2.5</version>
      ...
   </stack>
   
The ``<version>`` tag has a single text element, which is interpreted to
be the version number of the stack.  Surrounding whitespace in this
text element is stripped.  

The ``<version>`` tag has precedence over the
``rosbuild_make_distribution()`` macro.


Affected tools and libraries
----------------------------

The following tools are expected to be directly impacted by this
change and will require testing:

 * ``rospack``
 * ``rosstack``
 * ``rosdep``
 * ``roscreate-stack``
 * ``rosmake``

The following Python libraries will be updated to follow the
definition of unary stacks:

 * ``roslib.packages``
 * ``roslib.stacks``
 * ``roslib.manifest``
 * ``roslib.stack_manifest``

The following ROS wiki documentation macros will be updated to
represent unary stacks:

 * ``StackHeader()``
 * ``PackageHeader()``

For ease of deployment, ``StackHeader()`` and ``PackageHeader()`` will
treat unary stacks the same and represent both stack and package
metadata.

Releasing a unary stack
-----------------------

The largest required change is to the ROS release system [3]_.
Previously, stacks and packages each have a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file that
handles the required release behavior.  In order to simplify combining
these two entities, stacks will no longer be built by CMake.  Instead,
the release scripts will perform the necessary release packaging.

Deployment
==========

Unary stacks are targeted at the ROS Electric Emys release. We
anticipate migrating a small number of stacks to use the unary stack
system, but our priority is the stability of the distribution release.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Unary stacks are not backwards compatible with previous ROS
distributions and will not be released into ROS Diamondback.

In order to minimize the impact to stack dependencies, we will release
shell stacks for any stacks that are migrated to use the unary stack
system.  For example, when ``camera_drivers`` are separated into
individual unary stacks for each driver, we will release a new
``camera_drivers`` stack that depends on each of these stacks. Support
for these shell stacks will be maintained for a single ROS
distribution release, then removed.
