Abstract
========

``rospkg`` is a standalone Python package designed to supercede many
of the Python modules that exist in the ``roslib`` [1]_ library.  This
library provides APIs for accessing information on ROS packages and
stacks and is similar in functionality to the ``rospack`` and
``rosstack`` tools.

Motivation
==========

There are several motivating use cases:

 - Create supporting toolchain that is external to ROS distributions
 - Clean, supported API for ROS package system access
 - In the long term, minimize ROS package system dependencies

``roslib`` is one of the earliest Python modules written to support
ROS and has historically been an internal API used to develop a
variety of ROS tools and libraries, like ``rosmake`` [2]_, ``rosdep``
[3]_, ``rospy`` [4]_ and more.  It is long overdue for a rewrite to a
cleaner API, and it is also necessary to migrate it out of the normal
ROS package system in order to better support tools written against
it.

There are a variety of tools like ``rosinstall`` [5]_, ``create.py``
[6]_, and a large debian-packaging-building pipeline that have been
written to support the release and deployment of ROS software.  There
are also tools that support the documentation of ROS software, like
``rosdoc`` [6]_ and macros for the ROS wiki [8]_.  The software
supporting this infrastructure suffers from being part of the system
that it is being applied to.  

This coupling means that support tools, from documentation to release,
must use the APIs of the software they are being applied to or
duplicate them separately.  A different approach is to create a
separate, standalone library that is decoupled from ROS distribution
releases.  This library can be shared by the support tools and used by
libraries in ROS distribution releases, eliminating any duplication.
However, more care must be taken with a standalone library to retain
long-term backwards compatibility so that updates do not break
pre-existing software.

The most commonly used APIs in support tools relate to the ROS package
and build system.  As the ROS package and stack specification has been
relatively stable since the ROS 1.0 release, this is a good target for
a stable, standalone library.

In the longer term, the goal is to enable any developer to release
ROS-related tools and packages without depending on any particular ROS
distribution.  Currently, developers of ROS stacks have to declare a
dependency on the ROS stack in order to properly integrate with the
ROS packaging and build system.  Instead, Python-based tools like
``rosdep`` and ``rosmake`` could also be migrated to be external to
ROS distributions as well.

A related goal is to have the full ROS packaging and build system
available as a system dependency (e.g. a standard debian package
accepted in an Ubuntu distribution release).  This will provide
additional flexibility and options, such as using Launchpad PPAs, to
developers wishing to release ROS-related software.


Specification
=============

This REP introduces a new ``rospkg`` Python module that can be
installed installed via ``easy_install`` or ``pip`` to the standard
Python ``dist-packages`` location.  The ``rospkg`` library provides
ROS package and stack APIs.  It also provides an OS detection library
in a submodule.

The ``rospkg`` library is a replacement for existing libraries in
``roslib`` but it is not API compatible.

The ``rospkg`` Python module fully supercedes the following ``roslib``
Python modules:


 - ``roslib.manifest``
 - ``roslib.manifestlib``
 - ``roslib.os_detect``
 - ``roslib.packages``
 - ``roslib.stack_manifest``
 - ``roslib.stacks``
 
The ``rospkg`` Python module partially supercedes the following
``roslib`` Python modules:

 - ``roslib.environment`` 

The ``rospkg`` Python module also supercedes the ``rosdistro`` module.


environment APIs
----------------

The ``rospkg`` environment APIs are restricted to environment
variables that deal with the ROS packaging system and filesystem
locations.  It does not provide functionality related to the ROS graph
system (e.g. ``ROS_MASTER_URI``).

rospkg.RosPack
--------------

``rospkg.RosPack`` is a Python analogue of the ``rospack`` tool.  It
implements its own filesystem-crawling logic so it can be deployed in
environments without the ``rospack`` tool.  It is capable of reading
the ``rospack_cache`` file and implements internal caching so that it
can be used efficiently for repeated queries.

rospkg.RosStack
---------------

``rospkg.RosStack`` is a Python analogue of the ``rosstack`` tool.  It
implements its own filesystem-crawling logic so it can be deployed in
environments without the ``rosstack`` tool.  It is capable of reading
the ``rosstack_cache`` file and implements internal caching so that it
can be used efficiently for repeated queries.

rospkg.Manifest
---------------

The new ``rospkg.Manifest`` class supports parsing ``manifest.xml``
and ``stack.xml`` files.  It mainly supports the ``RosPack`` and
``RosStack`` APIs, so it's API is not publicly supported, yet.

rospkg.os_detect
----------------

The ``rospkg.os_detect`` submodule provides support for detecting the
platform that the ROS software is being run on, such as determining
the OS name and version.


Rationale
=========

rospkg.os_detect
----------------

``rospkg.RosPack`` and ``rospkg.RosStack`` are fairly straightforward
components to include in a ``rospkg`` library.  The inclusion of the
``rospkg.os_detect`` submodule is less clear.  

Tools like ``rosmake``, ``rosdep``, and ``rosinstall`` all have
OS-dependent behaviors that led to the development of the
``roslib.os_detect`` library.  In to support the future goal of making
all of these tools standalone, this library needs to be migrated to a
standalone library as well.

It is also the case that ROS package manifests have 
`<platform os="OS_NAME" version="OS_VERSION" />` tags meant to annotate 
package compatibility.  The values for ``OS_NAME`` and ``OS_VERSION``
are currently codified by the ``roslib.os_detect`` module, which means
that a ``rospkg`` library requires this information as well.

To balance this tension, the OS-detection libraries are presented as a
submodule so that they are separated from ROS package and stack APIs.

rosdistro
---------

There is a separate ``rosdistro`` ROS package that supports parsing of
ROS ``.rosdistro`` files.  These files describe a ROS distribution,
which is a collection of ROS stacks at a particular version.  

The ``rosdistro`` ROS package has been included for porting to rospkg 
as a ROS distribution is conceptually part of the ROS package ecosystem.
The rosdistro module is also heavily used in the toolchain that rospkg 
is intended to support. 

Recent changes to the ``rosdistro``` package have made it easier to port.  The
dependency on the ``vcstools`` package have been removed so the 
distribution-related code can now be packaged standalone.  

As distributions are not a primary concept like packages and stacks,
the distribution-related APIs are being kept in the ``rospkg.distro``
submodule.  These APIs are also not as stable as the package and stack
APIs.


Compatibility
=============

The ``rospkg`` module is not backwards compatible with the ``roslib``
module.  The intent is to have a clean API that is stable and can be
supported for a long period.

rospkg.RosPack
--------------

The dependency and rosdep APIs have been altered to only take in a
single package argument instead of a list of arguments.  Similarly,
the return values are now just the list of dependencies or rosdeps,
instead of a map of argument names to return values.  This change was
made as it is easy to implement a list-of-packages-style API on top of
the base API.

rospkg.Manifest
---------------

The new ``rospkg.Manifest`` class condenses the
``roslib.manifest.Manifest`` and ``roslib.manifest.StackManifest``
classes into a single class in order to streamline the implementation.
It also removes the ability to marshal instances to XML, which is not
vital functionality and is bug-prone.

os_detect
---------

The ``rospkg.os_detect`` module differs from ``roslib.os_detect`` in the
definition of an OS "version".  In the ``roslib`` API, version
can be a codename or a pure version number, depending on the specific OS.
This is largely an artifact of the library originally being a rosdep support
library.  

In the interest of consistency and supporting a longer-term API, the
definitionis have been migrated to be more like ``lsb_release``-style
[9]_, which provides the version number and codename separately.


rospkg.distro
-------------

The new ``rospkg.distro`` format streamlines the distribution API by
removing backwards-compatibility support for older rosdistro formats.
It also simplifies up access to stack and release information.


Open issues
===========

roslib.load_manifest
--------------------

The ``roslib.load_manifest`` and related ``from ros import <package>``
APIs have not yet been ported to the ``rospkg`` library.  These APIs
are largely the reason why ROS installations require configuration of
the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable -- though there are many tools
tha also use this configuration to access other roslib libraries.

It is possible that this setup requirement could be phased out of
future ROS distribution releases if we include this functionality, but
the analysis has not yet been done as to whether or not this can be
supported in the long-term under the backwards-compatibility
requirement of rospkg.

Manifest
--------

The new ``rospkg.Manifest`` class API is not considered API stable at
this point.  Better accessors (e.g. property decorators) and other
validation logic may be added that could alter the API.  For now, the
``rospkg.Manifest`` API should not be directly manipulated, and
relevant information should be extracted via the ``RosPack`` and
``RosStack`` APIs.
