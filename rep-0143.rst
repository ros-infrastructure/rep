Abstract
========
This REP updates the specification of the ROS distribution files facilitated in
the building, packaging, testing and documenting process.

The intention is to separate the buildfarm related configuration options from
the information describing the ROS packages and repositories [1]_ [2]_.

This REP is a revised version of REP 141 [3]_.
It currently does not repeat the content of REP 141 but only states the
differences.


Specification
=============

Index file
----------

* distributions

  * distribution: list of reference to the distribution files
    A single distribution file guarantees that there are no duplicate
    repositories and is therefore preferred.
    But when running a custom buildfarm which only adds custom repositories it
    is much smoother to maintain them in a separate file to avoid any kind of
    conflicts.

    The files are read in the order they are listed and entries in later
    distribution files are overwriting entries from previous distribution
    files.
    This can be used to override specific repositories with either a forked
    variant or a specific version number.
    ``bloom`` will create pull requests against the last distribution file
    since even when the repository is present in any of the other distribution
    files the "overlaying" version should be stored in the last one.

  * release_builds / source_builds / doc_builds: are being removed since they
    only contain information relevant to the buildfarm

* version: version number, this REP describes version 3 (instead of version 2
  described in REP 141 [3]_ and version 1 described in REP 137 [4]_)


Distribution file
-----------------

* repositories

  * source

    * test_commits: a boolean flag used to enable CI jobs for each commit to
      the branch specified under ``versions``. (default: false)
    * test_pull_requests: a boolean flag used to enable CI jobs for each pull
      request against the branch specified under ``version``. (default: false)
    * version: if ``test_pull_requests`` is enabled the version must specify a
      branch.
    * test_abi: a boolean flag used when ``test_pull_requests`` is enabled to
      perform an ABI/API check on the changes. (default: false)

* tags: list of tag names to identify the group of repositories specified by
  the distribution file.
  It allows build files to refer to sets of repositories / packages based on in
  which distribution file they are defined.

* version: version number, this REP describes version 2 (instead of version 1
  described in REP 141 [3]_ and REP 137 [4]_)


Reference implementation
------------------------
This REP is to be implemented in version 0.4 of the Python package *rosdistro*.
It will serve as a reference implementation for this REP.
A draft implementation can be found in [5]_.


Compatibility issues
====================

The draft implementation of rosdistro is able to parse both index format
version 2 as well as 3.

To leverage the new ability to list multiple distribution files the following
additional API will be introduced:

* rosdistro.get_distribution_files()

The existing API ('rosdistro.get_distribution_file()') will continue to provide
the correct data by merging the information from all distribution files.

All function related to the removed build files will simply return empty lists.

As soon as the new version of 'rosdistro' is released the 'ros/rosdistro'
repository [6]_ is being updated to the new format (for Hydro and higher).
Any client accessing trying to access the data with an old 'rosdistro'
version will get an error message like this:

::

  Unable to handle 'index' format version '3', please update rosdistro...

Affected tools
--------------

The only tool beside the "old" buildfarm accessing the raw rosdistro data which
needs to be updated is 'rosdep' [7]_.

All other tools using the API of rosdistro (even if deprecated) will continue
to work.

In order to allow releasing packages into rosdistro repositories with multiple
distribution files 'bloom' will need to be updated [8]_.
