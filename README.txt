reStructuredText for REPs
=========================

This is a direct search-and-replace port of the Python PEP
scripts at:

http://svn.python.org/projects/peps/trunk/

Original (modified) README.txt follows:

Original REP source is written using the reStructuredText
format. This format is described in REP 12. The rep2html.py
processing and installation script knows how to produce the
HTML for the REP format. A local copy of the Docutils
package is included for processing reStructuredText REPs.
