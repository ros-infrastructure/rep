Abstract
========

This REP describes the path for switching from Python 2 to Python 3 in ROS 1.

Motivation
==========

As described in the Python release schedule [1]_ Python 2.7 will only receive
bugfix releases until 2020.
As a consequence Ubuntu is trying to demote Python 2.7 into the `universe`
repository [2]_.
While it is unlikely that Python 2.7 will be removed from the archives entirely,
it should not be relied on past its EOL date.
Therefore ROS 1 must move to Python 3.

Context
=======

Different versions of Python can't be mixed within a single ROS distribution.
A package using Python 3 can't import Python modules from a package built using
Python 2.
All ROS packages containing Python code need to support Python 3 before they can
be released into Noetic.

Past proposals for Python 3 support have assumed a ROS distro will need to
support Python 2 and Python 3 at the same time.
Since then it was decided the first ROS 1 distribution to support Python 3
will be Noetic Ninjemys (May 2020) [3]_, and it will only support Python 3.
This REP only describes the current proposal since the change in requirements
has made past proposals obsolete.

This proposal does not specify a minimum minor version for Python.
The minimum version will be defined in REP 3 [4]_ together with all other
versions.

Proposal
========

Python 3 support at the time of Noetic release means:

* All ROS tooling supports creating a Python 3 only ROS distro
* All ROS packages released to Noetic support Python 3

The amount of work to transition to Python 3 is expected to be significant.
The entire ROS community will need to share the workload.
This effort should be started as soon as possible to reduce the risk of the
Noetic release being delayed.

Tooling support for Python 3
----------------------------

rosdep keys
'''''''''''
All exsiting Python rosdep keys including ``<platform>_python3`` entries will
stay the same to avoid breaking unknown existing use cases.
Even if a key refers to a Python 2 package on one platform and Python 3 on
another, it should stay that way.

Some Python rosdep keys have ``<platform>_python3`` entries.
This was an experiment at having a rosdep key conditionally evaluate to either
a Python 2 or Python 3 system dependency.
No new ``<platform>_python3`` entries should be added, and the entries should
not be relied on.

For new Python keys, when a platform has separate Python 2 and Python 3 versions
of a package, there should be a rosdep key for each.
For example, consider the two keys ``python-catkin-pkg`` and ``python3-catkin-pkg``.
The ``python-catkin-pkg`` key should resolve to a Python 2 dependency on any
platform where one exists, while ``python3-catkin-pkg`` should only resolve to a
Python 3 dependency.


ROS_PYTHON_VERSION
''''''''''''''''''

``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` is an environment variable that is set to either ``2`` or
``3`` to indicate the major version of Python supported by a ROS distro.
The intent is to allow ``package.xml`` files to have conditional Python
dependencies.

It is set by the package ``ros_environment`` when sourcing a ROS workspace.
The version set will be dictated by REP 3 [4]_.
For example, in Melodic it defaults to ``2``, but in Noetic it must be ``3``.

Users building ROS from source will not have an existing ROS workspace set, so
the variable won't be set and conditional dependencies can't be evalulated
when using ``rosdep`` to install them.
To fix this, ``rosdep`` should set ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` to the same version of
Python used to invoke it.
It will get this information using ``sys.version[0]``.
A user wanting to use a different Python version must set ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION``
explicitly.

rosdep and pip packages
'''''''''''''''''''''''
Unlike debian packages, keys that resolve to packages on PyPI may refer to
either Python 2 or Python 3 dependencies.
The version that gets downloaded depends on the version of Python used to
invoke pip.
Rosdep currently calls the command ``pip``.
It might use Python 2 when using the debian package ``python-pip``, but it could
use Python 3 inside a venv.

``rosdep`` could default to ``sys.executable -m pip`` to use the same version of
Python as rosdep, but a user building the ROS 1 bridge for Melodic is likely
using the debian package ``python3-rosdep``.
To support this, rosdep should use ``python$ROS_PYTHON_VERSION -m pip``.
Since ``rosdep`` sets ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` for itself if unset, this will default
to the same version of Python as rosdep if ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` is unset, but
it can still be overridden automatically when a ROS workspace is sourced.

ROS packages support for Python 3
---------------------------------

There are many ROS packages using Python that will need to be modified to
support Python 3.
Packages using different branches for different ROS distros can drop support
for Python 2 in their Noetic branch.
Packages which use the same branch in multiple ROS distros may need to support
both Python 2 and Python 3 at the same time.
This section describes what needs to be done in both cases.

Shebangs and reliance on the Python command
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Python scripts on unix systemx typically have shebang lines written as:

.. code-block: bash

    #!/usr/bin/env python

PEP 394 recommends distributed Python scripts to use either ``python2`` or
``python3`` [7]_.
The ``python`` command cannot be trusted to a spefic Python version.
On older ROS distros, scripts can continue to use ``python`` since they're known
to work on those platforms.
In preparation for Noetic, these shebang's should be rewritten to the specific
version of Python supported, ``python3``.

Packages using the same branch will need to conditionally rewrite the shebangs.
Packages can use the CMake macro ``catkin_install_python()`` to install Python
scripts with rewritten shebangs.

The same issue appears in scripts that call the ``python`` command directly.
If they are Python scripts, they should be modified to invoke ``sys.executable``.
Otherwise, they should be edited to invoke the specific version of Python they
require, or ``python$ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` if the script works with both.

Dependencies and package.xml
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

On platforms where the target version of Python is 2, the package.xml of a ROS
package must refer to Python 2 dependencies, and when the target Python
version is 3 it must refer to Python 3 dependencies.
Packages which release from different branches for each ROS distro can replace
rosdep keys that resolve to Python 2 dependencies to ones that resolve to
Python 3 equivalents.
Packages using the same code base for multiple ROS distros should instead use
conditional dependencies as described in REP 149 [5]_.

.. code-block: xml

    <depend condition="$ROS_PYTHON_VERSION == '2'">python-numpy</depend>
    <depend condition="$ROS_PYTHON_VERSION == '3'">python3-numpy</depend>

If ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` is relied upon at build time, such as when using
``catkin_install_python()`` to rewrite shebangs, then the package must declare a
``<buildtool_depend>`` on ``ros_environment``.
Any ROS package which uses ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` in a script intended to be
run at runtime should add an ``<exec_depend>`` tag for ``ros_environment``.

Making Python fixes available to downstream packages
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Transitioning to Python 3 is expected to be a significant effort.
Typicically ROS packages are tested using the ROS build farm; however, that
will not be available until packages for the targeted Ubuntu distribution
become available.
Instead, a placehoder ``Noetic`` ``distribution.yaml`` will be made available in
advance of the buildfarm availability.
Maintainers should add ``source`` entries for their Noetic branches to this file
to enable downstream users to use ``rosinstall_generator`` with the
``--upstream-development`` flag to get Python 3 fixes.
Instructions to build from source using Python 3 will be made available to
the ROS community.

Once the build farm is available, maintainers should release packages with
Python 3 fixes to Noetic as soon as possible, even if they intend to make
breaking changes later.

Organizing Community effort
---------------------------

In order to achieve this, prior to the Noetic release community members must
be able to see:

* which ROS packages already support Python 3
* which ROS packages need help supporting Python 3

The presence of a ``source`` entry in the Noetic ``distribution.yaml`` should be
taken to mean a package has started transitioning to Python 3.
Community members can use the differences between this and the previous ROS
distro's ``distribution.yaml`` as an indication of which packages would benefit
the most from their contributions.

There are many ROS package maintainers in the community, and each has the
responsibility of deciding how the packages they maintain should make the
transition to Python 3.
On an individual repository level, community members are encouraged to open
issues and pull requests with Python 3 fixes.
