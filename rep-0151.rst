Abstract
========

This REP describes the path for switching from Python 2 to Python 3 in ROS 1.

Motivation
==========

As described in the Python release schedule [1]_ Python 2.7 will only receive
bugfix releases until 2020.
As a consequence Ubuntu is trying to demote Python 2.7 into the `universe`
repository [2]_.
While it is unlikely that Python 2.7 will be removed from the archives entirely,
it should not be relied on past its EOL date.
Therefore ROS 1 must move to Python 3.

Context
=======

Past proposals for Python 3 support have assumed a ROS distro will need to
support Python 2 and Python 3 at the same time.
Since then it was decided the first ROS 1 distribution to support Python 3
will be Noetic Ninjemys (May 2020) [3]_, and it will only support Python 3.
This REP only describes the current proposal since the change in requirements
has made past proposals obsolete.
All ROS packages containing Python code need to support Python 3 before they can
be released into Noetic.

This proposal does not specify a minimum minor version for Python.
The minimum version will be defined in REP 3 [4]_ together with all other
versions.

Proposal
========

Python 3 support at the time of Noetic release means:

* All ROS tooling supports creating a Python 3 only ROS distro
* All ROS packages released to Noetic support Python 3

The amount of work to transition to Python 3 is expected to be significant.
The entire ROS community will need to share the workload.
This effort should be started as soon as possible to reduce the risk of the
Noetic release being delayed.

Tooling support for Python 3
----------------------------

rosdep keys
'''''''''''
Some Python rosdep keys have ``<platform>_python3`` entries.
This was an experiment at having a rosdep key conditionally evaluate to either
a Python 2 or Python 3 system dependency.
No new ``<platform>_python3`` entries should be added, and the entries should
not be relied on.

All existing Python rosdep keys including ``<platform>_python3`` entries will
stay the same to avoid breaking unknown existing use cases.
Even if a key refers to a Python 2 package on one platform and Python 3 on
another, it should stay that way.

For new Python keys, when a platform has separate Python 2 and Python 3 versions
of a package, there should be a rosdep key for each.
For example, consider the two keys ``python-catkin-pkg`` and ``python3-catkin-pkg``.
The ``python-catkin-pkg`` key should resolve to a Python 2 dependency on any
platform where one exists, while ``python3-catkin-pkg`` should only resolve to a
Python 3 dependency.


ROS_PYTHON_VERSION
''''''''''''''''''

``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` is an environment variable that is set to either ``2`` or
``3`` to indicate the major version of Python supported by a ROS distro.
The intent is to allow ``package.xml`` files to have conditional Python
dependencies.

It is set by the package ``ros_environment`` when sourcing a ROS workspace.
The version set will be dictated by REP 3 [4]_.
For example, in Melodic it defaults to ``2``, but in Noetic it must be ``3``.

Users building ROS from source will not have an existing ROS workspace set, so
the variable won't be set, and conditional dependencies can't be evaluated
when using ``rosdep`` to install them.
To fix this, ``rosdep`` will set ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION``.
It must choose a Python version to match the ROS distro while allowing platforms
that already use Python 3 to override it

The choice is made using the following information:

 * the command line option ``--rosdistro``
 * the environment variable ``ROS_DISTRO``
 * the environment variable ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION``
 * the value ``python_version`` in the ROS distribution file [8]_
 * the version of Python used to invoke ``rosdep`` via ``sys.version[0]``

If ``--rosdistro`` is set then the value of ``python_version`` in the ROS distro
file is used.
For the purpose of evaluating conditional dependencies, ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION``
will be set to ``python_version``, and ``ROS_DISTRO`` will be set to the value
passed in via ``--rosdistro``.
This allows users who may be unaware they have an existing ROS workspace sourced
to install dependencies for a different ROS distro.

Otherwise, if ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` is set then that value is used.
The value of ``ROS_DISTRO`` is unchanged whether it is set or unset.
This allows users to install dependencies for a ROS distro with a different
Python version than the ROS distro targets, such as Arch Linux users using
Python 3 for ROS Melodic.

If ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` is not set but ``ROS_DISTRO`` is then
for the purpose of evaluating conditional dependencies ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION``
will be set to the value of ``python_version``.
This makes sure ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` dependencies get evaluated in a way that
matches the desired distro.
This case should not happen so long as the user has sourced a workspace with the
``ros_environment`` package, since that package sets both ``ROS_DISTRO`` and
``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION``.

Finally, if none of ``--rosdistro``, ``ROS_DISTRO`` or ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` are set
then for the purpose of evaluating conditional dependencies ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION``
will be set to ``sys.version[0]``.
This makes sure ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` dependencies are not silently ignored,
though there is a risk of installing the wrong packages.

rosdep and pip packages
'''''''''''''''''''''''
Unlike Debian packages, keys that resolve to packages on PyPI may refer to
either Python 2 or Python 3 dependencies.
The version that gets downloaded depends on the version of Python used to
invoke pip.
Rosdep currently calls the command ``pip``.
It might use Python 2 when using the Debian package ``python-pip``, but it could
use Python 3 inside a venv.
``rosdep`` should pick a version of pip that matches ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION``
regardless of whether a Python virtual env is being used.

First ``rosdep`` will try the commands ``pip2`` or ``pip3`` since those are
similar to the previous usage of ``pip``.
If those don't exist and ``sys.version[0]`` is the same value as
``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` then it will try ``sys.executable -m pip``.
If that didn't work, then as a last resort it will try the commands
``python2 -m pip`` or ``python3 -m pip``.

ROS packages support for Python 3
---------------------------------

There are many ROS packages using Python that will need to be modified to
support Python 3.
Packages using different branches for different ROS distros can drop support
for Python 2 in their Noetic branch.
Packages which use the same branch in multiple ROS distros may need to support
both Python 2 and Python 3 at the same time.
This section describes what needs to be done in both cases.

Shebangs and reliance on the Python command
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Python scripts on UNIX systems typically have shebang lines written as:

.. code-block: bash

    #!/usr/bin/env python

PEP 394 recommends distributed Python scripts to use either ``python2`` or
``python3`` [7]_.
The ``python`` command cannot be trusted to a specific Python version.
On older ROS distros, scripts can continue to use ``python`` since they're known
to work on those platforms.
These shebangs must be rewritten to the specific version of Python supported.
Packages can use the CMake macro ``catkin_install_python()`` to install Python
scripts with rewritten shebangs.
It will create a relay script in the ``devel`` space with a rewritten shebang.

The same issue appears in scripts that call the ``python`` command directly.
If they are Python scripts, they should invoke ``sys.executable``.
Otherwise, they should invoke the specific version of Python they
require, which means templating the script to invoke the Python interpreter
found when the package was built.

Dependencies and package.xml
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

On platforms where the target version of Python is 2, the package.xml of a ROS
package must refer to Python 2 dependencies, and when the target Python
version is 3 it must refer to Python 3 dependencies.
Packages which release from different branches for each ROS distro can replace
rosdep keys that resolve to Python 2 dependencies with ones that resolve to
Python 3 equivalents.
Packages using the same code base for multiple ROS distros should instead use
conditional dependencies as described in REP 149 [5]_.

.. code-block: xml

    <depend condition="$ROS_PYTHON_VERSION == '2'">python-numpy</depend>
    <depend condition="$ROS_PYTHON_VERSION == '3'">python3-numpy</depend>

If ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` is relied upon at build time, such as when using
``catkin_install_python()`` to rewrite shebangs, then the package must declare a
``<buildtool_depend>`` on ``ros_environment``.
Any ROS package which uses ``ROS_PYTHON_VERSION`` in a script intended to be
run at runtime should add an ``<exec_depend>`` tag for ``ros_environment``.

Making Python fixes available to downstream packages
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Transitioning to Python 3 is expected to be a significant effort.
Maintainers should release packages with Python 3 fixes to Noetic as soon as
possible, even if they intend to make breaking changes later.
Maintainers should also add ``source`` entries for their Noetic branches to this
file to enable downstream users to use ``rosinstall_generator`` with the
``--upstream-development`` flag to get Python 3 fixes.
Instructions to build from source using Python 3 have been made available to
the ROS community [9]_.


Organizing community effort
---------------------------

In order to achieve this, prior to the Noetic release community members must
be able to see:

* which ROS packages already support Python 3
* which ROS packages need help supporting Python 3

The presence of a ``source`` entry in the Noetic ``distribution.yaml`` should be
taken to mean a package has started transitioning to Python 3.
Community members can use the differences between this and the previous ROS
distro's ``distribution.yaml`` as an indication of which packages would benefit
the most from their contributions via the Blocked Releases [10]_ or Blocked
Source Entries [11]_ pages.

There are many ROS package maintainers in the community, and each has the
responsibility of deciding how the packages they maintain should make the
transition to Python 3.
On an individual repository level, community members are encouraged to open
issues and pull requests with Python 3 fixes.
