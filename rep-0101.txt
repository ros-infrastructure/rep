Abstract
========

This REP describes the ROS 1.4 release schedule. The schedule
primarily concerns itself with large-impact additions. For general
high-level planning, see the ROS Roadmap [1]_. As per general ROS
stack development guidelines, features for ROS 1.4 will be developed
in the ROS 1.3.x release cycle and finalized for ROS 1.4.0.

Release Schedule
================

The schedule below is tentative. The target date for the ROS
Diamondback distribution in February, 2011. Features for ROS 1.4 may
be shifted to ROS 1.6 as appropriate to meet the Diamondback
distribution release schedule.

* Early September, 2010: rx stack release, new release system testing
* Late September, 2010: First rosh release
* Mid October, 2010: ros/ros_comm separation, roslisp message generator rewrite
* November, 2010: ros and ros_comm stacks feature freeze
* December, 2010: First rxlab release
* January, 2010: rx stack feature freeze, ros_realtime stack
* Release candidate

Features for ROS 1.4
====================

* ROS stack separation into ros, rx, ros_comm, and documentation stacks (REP 100 [#REP100]_, tfoote, kwc)
* New `external stack release system`_, new rosdistro format (leibs, kwc, tfoote)
* rosh_ : basic release with support for topics, services, and parameters (kwc)
* rxlab_ GUI tool (tfield)
* rospy client reconnection (kwc)
* rosbuild install target prototype (gerkey)
* ros_realtime_ stack (jfaust, possibly delay to post-Diamondback)
* Python message generators for roslisp (bhaskara)
* rosbag speed optimization (lazy index loading; multi-threaded
  read/write) and compression (message reordering; gzip) (leibs,
  tfield)
* rosbag service APIs (leibs, tfield)

Optional Features for ROS 1.4
=============================

Optional features are "nice-to-haves" but are not considered critical
path for this release, nor do they impact downstream components. They
will be scheduled if time permits.

* roslaunch-console_ (kwc)
* ROS master Redis-protoype with TTL and master replication (kwc)
* redo ROS/OS X platform integration to use easy_install for Python dependencies, drop support for OSX 10.4 (kwc, tfoote)

Motivation
==========

The ROS 1.4 release has several main thrusts:

- Separating the ROS stack into smaller components
- Incorporating community stacks into ROS distributions
- New rapid prototyping tools for ROS-based code (rosh, rxlab)

Of these thrusts, separation of the ROS stack is expected to have the
broadest impact. It should enable the ROS packaging and build system
to be used outside of ROS, and it will also help with integration on
other platforms (e.g. embedded, OS X, Windows). The motivation and
rationale are better described in REP 100 [#REP100]_.

Incorporating community stacks is a priority as there are over 30 ROS
repositories now. Having a shared mechanism for release and
distribution will enable the community to more easily exchange
libraries, including helping address issues of versioning and system
configuration. This will also be a test for future developments in the
release system, such as supporting alternate distributions
(e.g. distributions for specific robot platforms or research areas).

rosh and rxlab are being designed as complementary tools for rapid
prototyping. rosh is a Python- and IPython-based framework with that
enables tab-completion on ROS resources (e.g. topics, services,
parameters, actions, transforms. rxlab is a Python GUI framework that
enables creation of "networks" within a single Python process to do a
variety of tasks, such as creating image-processing pipelines. It is
similar to frameworks such as Simulink, but is targeted at ROS
libraries like OpenCV. rosh and rxlab are being built on top of the
existing Python toolchain as they provide many of the necessary
libraries for dynamic introspection in a ROS graph.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

The ROS backwards compatibility guidelines require that ROS 1.4 being
fully backwards compatible with ROS 1.2. The main concern for this
release will be ensuring that the separation of the ROS stack into
three stacks will not an existing code to break. This will likely
require additional resources and files to remain with the base "ros"
stack in the 1.4 release, but deprecated so that they can be removed
in the 1.6 release.
