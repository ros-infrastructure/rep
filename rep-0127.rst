Abstract
========

This REP specifies a new package manifest format, initially released
with Groovy Galapagos.  It is only relevant for packages using the new
catkin buildsystem.  The new ``package.xml`` file replaces
``stack.xml`` and ``manifest.xml``, used with the earlier rosbuild
tools.


Motivation
==========

The decision to remove the concept of stacks, leaving only packages
[8]_, drove the decision to merge the information contained in both
``stack.xml`` and ``manifest.xml``.

The ``package.xml`` contains several kinds of information:

 * descriptive data (i.e. a description, maintainer)
 * dependencies on other ROS and system packages
 * meta-information (i.e. the author and website)
 * packaging information (i.e. the version)


Rationale
=========

A new filename replacing the existing ones
------------------------------------------

Instead of modifying the semantics and content of the old files a new
filename is chosen to make it possible to distinguish old and new
packages without parsing the contents of the xml file.

One file per package with all the information
---------------------------------------------

Each package has one ``package.xml`` which contains all necessary
data, instead of multiple separate files with semantically grouped
information.  Several tools, like the buildfarm and the wiki, need to
use that information.  They only need to fetch one file from each
source package.

Store normalized data
---------------------

All data are stored in atomic units for automated processing.  For
example, names and email addresses are stored separately.

Data format
-----------

Besides XML, which was used for ``stack.xml`` and ``manifest.xml``,
other formats were considered.  YAML was investigated extensively
during the Fuerte cycle, because it is easier for humans to read.
Since benchmark results [6]_ showed YAML parsing in Python to be
ten times slower, the XML format remains.

Tags versus attributes
----------------------

While plain text information can be stored in either attributes or
tags the later is preferred for readability reasons.

Additional, mostly optional, information is stored in attributes of
the related tag instead of grouping multiple tags inside a parent tag.

XML syntax restrictions
-----------------------

The allowed ``package.xml`` elements are tightly restricted.  That
way, tools can reliably detect errors and provide meaningful error
messages should a user misspell any of the tags defined here.

Within the ``<export>`` element, tools may define additional tags,
free from those restrictions.

If new top-level tags are needed, the ``format`` attribute of the
``<package>`` tag provides a migration path.

Package name restrictions
-------------------------

Package names are used in various contexts:

 * namespaces
 * variables
 * part of a binary package name (i.e. Debian [4]_, Fedora [5]_)

All ROS package names must be mapped to these conventions without
generating collision.  Therefore only lower case letters (a-z),
numbers (0-9) and one delimiting character (_) can be used.  The
additional restriction that the first character be a letter is due to
the requirements of some languages for naming packages or namespaces.


Data representation
===================

The package manifest is an XML file, with restricted syntax.

The only top-level element allowed is ``<package>``.  Immediately
subordinate to that are several required or optional elements, defined
here.  No other tags are permitted directly under the ``<package>``
element.

<package>
---------

The ``<package>`` tag is the unique top-level tag in a ``package.xml``
file.  All other tags are nested under it.

Attributes
''''''''''

  ``format="NUMBER"`` *(optional)*

  Specifying the ``package.xml`` format being used.  If not set, the
  default ``format="1"`` is assumed.  That is the only format
  described here.  If you are using a different format, please refer
  to the relevant specification.  REP-0140 will describe format two.

Required Tags
-------------

The required tags in a ``package.xml`` file provide package meta-data:

 * `\<name\>`_
 * `\<version\>`_
 * `\<description\>`_
 * `\<maintainer\> (multiple, but at least one)`_
 * `\<license\> (multiple, but at least one)`_

Optional Tags
-------------

Meta-information
''''''''''''''''

Optional, but recommended, meta-data include the names of the original
authors and links to support documentation.

 * `\<url\> (multiple)`_
 * `\<author\> (multiple)`_

Dependencies
''''''''''''

The dependencies and relations to other packages and system packages
have been discussed in [8]_ and are described using:

 * `\<build_depend\> (multiple)`_
 * `\<buildtool_depend\> (multiple)`_
 * `\<run_depend\> (multiple)`_
 * `\<test_depend\> (multiple)`_
 * `\<conflict\> (multiple)`_
 * `\<replace\> (multiple)`_

Various
'''''''

There is a need for additional meta-data in the manifest for other
tools that work with packages, like message generators and plugin
discovery.  All of this *dynamic* information is stored in tags under
a single tag:

 * `\<export\>`_

Tool providers are responsible for defining the tag structure their
tool requires.

Example
-------

::

  <package>
    <name>my_package</name>
    <version>1.2.3</version>
    <description>
      ROS communications-related packages, including core client
      libraries (roscpp, rospy, roslisp) and graph introspection tools
      (rostopic, rosnode, rosservice, rosparam).
    </description>
    <maintainer email="someone@example.com">Someone</maintainer>

    <license>BSD</license>
    <license>LGPL</license>

    <url type="website">http://wiki.ros.org/my_package</url>
    <url type="bugtracker">http://www.github.com/my_org/my_package/issues</url>
    <author>John Doe</author>
    <author email="jane.doe@example.com">Jane Doe</author>

    <build_depend>catkin</build_depend>
    <build_depend version_gte="1.1" version_lt="2.0">genmsg</build_depend>

    <build_depend>libboost-thread-dev</build_depend>
    <run_depend>libboost-thread</run_depend>

    <test_depend>gtest</test_depend>

    <conflict>my_old_package</conflict>

    <export>
      ...
    </export>
  </package>


<name>
------

The package name must start with a letter and contain only lowercase
alphabetic, numeric or underscore characters [1]_.  The package name
should be unique within the ROS community.  It may differ from the
folder name into which it is checked out, but that is *not* recommended.


<version>
---------

The version number of the package in the format ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``
where each part is numeric only.


<description>
-------------

The description of the package. It can consist of multiple lines and
may contain XHTML.  But depending on where the description is used
XML tags and multiple whitespaces might be stripped.


<maintainer> (multiple, but at least one)
-----------------------------------------

The name of the person maintaining the package.  All packages require
a maintainer.  For orphaned packages see below.

Attributes
''''''''''

 ``email="name@domain.tld"`` *(required)*

  Email address of the maintainer.

An orphaned package is one with no current maintainer.  Orphaned
packages should have their maintainer set to ``ROS Community
<ros-release@code.ros.org>``.  These packages will be maintained by
the ROS Community as a whole until a volunteer takes over maintenance.

Example
'''''''

::

  <maintainer email="ros-release@code.ros.org">ROS Community</maintainer>


<license> (multiple, but at least one)
--------------------------------------

Name of license for this package, e.g. BSD, GPL, LGPL.  In order to
assist machine readability, only include the license name in this tag.
For multiple licenses multiple separate tags must be used.  A package
will have multiple licenses if different source files have different
licenses.  Every license occurring in the source files should have
a corresponding ``<license>`` tag.  For any explanatory text about
licensing caveats, please use the ``<description>`` tag.

Most common open-source licenses are described on the
`OSI website <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical>`_.

Commonly used license strings:

 - Apache 2.0
 - BSD
 - Boost Software License
 - GPLv2
 - GPLv3
 - LGPLv2.1
 - LGPLv3
 - MIT 
 - Mozilla Public License Version 1.1

<url> (multiple)
----------------

A Uniform Resource Locator for the package's website, bug tracker or
source repository.

It is a good idea to include ``<url>`` tags pointing users to these
resources.  The website is commonly a wiki page on ``ros.org`` where
users can find and update information about the package.

Attributes
''''''''''

 ``type="TYPE"`` *(optional)*

 The type should be one of the following identifiers: ``website``
 (default), ``bugtracker`` or ``repository``.


<author> (multiple)
-------------------

The name of a person who is an author of the package, as
acknowledgement of their work and for questions.

Attributes
''''''''''

 ``email="name@domain.tld"`` *(optional)*

  Email address of author.


<build_depend> (multiple)
-------------------------

Declares a rosdep key or ROS package name that this package requires
at build-time.

The ``build`` and ``buildtool`` dependencies are used to determine
the build order of multiple packages.

Attributes
''''''''''

 All dependencies and relationships may restrict their applicability
 to particular versions.  For each comparison operator an attribute
 can be used.  Two of these attributes can be used together to
 describe a version range.

 ``version_lt="VERSION"`` *(optional)*

 The dependency to the package is restricted to versions less than
 the stated version number.

 ``version_lte="VERSION"`` *(optional)*

 The dependency to the package is restricted to versions less or
 equal than the stated version number.

 ``version_eq="VERSION"`` *(optional)*

 The dependency to the package is restricted to a version equal than
 the stated version number.

 ``version_gte="VERSION"`` *(optional)*

 The dependency to the package is restricted to versions greater or
 equal than the stated version number.

 ``version_gt="VERSION"`` *(optional)*

 The dependency to the package is restricted to versions greater than
 the stated version number.


<buildtool_depend> (multiple)
-----------------------------

Declares a rosdep key or ROS package name for a tool that is executed
during the build process.  For cross-compilation, one must distinguish
these from normal build dependencies, which may be linked with your
package and must be compiled for the target architecture, not the
build system.

Attributes 
''''''''''

 The same attributes as for `\<build_depend\> (multiple)`_.


<run_depend> (multiple)
-----------------------

Declares a rosdep key or ROS package name that this package needs
either at run-time or as part of some exported build interface.

The ``<run_depend>`` declares two different types of package
dependencies.  One is for shared libraries, executables, Python
modules, launch scripts and other files required for running your
package. 

The second type of ``<run_depend>`` is for transitive build
dependencies.  A common example is when one of your dependencies
provides a header file included in some header exported by your
package.  Even if your package does not use that header when building
itself, other packages depending on your header *will* require those
transitive dependencies when they are built.

Attributes
''''''''''

 The same attributes as for `\<build_depend\> (multiple)`_.


<test_depend> (multiple)
------------------------

Declares a rosdep key or ROS package name that your package needs for
running its unit tests.

A ``<test_depend>`` may not reference any package also declared using
a ``<build_depend>``, ``<buildtool_depend>`` or ``<run_depend>``.

Attributes
''''''''''

 The same attributes as for `\<build_depend\> (multiple)`_.


<conflict> (multiple)
---------------------

Declares a rosdep key or ROS package name with which your package
conflicts.  This package and the conflicting package cannot be
installed at the same time.  This maps to ``conflicts`` for both
``dpkg`` and ``rpms``.

For a detailed explanation how these relationships are used see
[4]_ and [5]_.

Attributes
''''''''''

 The same attributes as for `\<build_depend\> (multiple)`_.


<replace> (multiple)
--------------------

Declares a rosdep key or ROS package name that your package replaces.
This maps to ``Replaces`` for ``dpkg`` and ``Obsoletes`` for ``rpms``.

Attributes
''''''''''

 The same attributes as for `\<build_depend\> (multiple)`_.


<export>
--------

This tag serves as a container for additional information various
packages and subsystems need to embed.  To avoid potential collisions
packages must use their package name as their tag name inside the
export block.  The content of that tag is up to the package to define
and use.

Existing rosbuild export tags for tools using ``pluginlib`` remain
unchanged.  For example, a package which implements an rviz plugin
might include this::

  <export>
    <rviz plugin="${prefix}/plugin_description.xml"/>
  </export>

The following are some tags used within an ``<export>`` for various
package and message generation tasks.

<architecture_independent/>
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This empty tag indicates that your package contains no
architecture-specific files.

<deprecated>
''''''''''''

This tag indicates that your package is deprecated, enabling tools to
notify users about that fact.  The tag may be empty or may optionally
contain an arbitrary text providing user more information about the
deprecation::

  <export>
    <deprecated>
      This package will be removed in ROS Hydro. Instead, use package
      FOO, which provides similar features with a different API.
    </deprecated>
  </export>

<message_generator>
'''''''''''''''''''

The content defines the *identifier* for the language bindings
generated by this package, i.e. in ``gencpp`` this is set to ``cpp``::

  <export>
    <message_generator>cpp</message_generator>
  </export>

<metapackage/>
''''''''''''''

This empty tag declares a special kind of catkin package used for
grouping other packages.  Users who install the Debian or RPM package
for a catkin metapackage will also get all the packages directly or
indirectly included in its group.  Metapackages may not install any
code or other files, although ``package.xml`` does get installed
automatically.  They can depend on other metapackages, if desired, but
regular catkin packages cannot.

Metapackages can be used to resolve dependencies declared by legacy
rosbuild stacks not yet converted to catkin.  Catkin packages must
depend directly on the packages they use, not on any metapackages.

A good use for metapackages is to group the major components of your
robot and then provide a comprehensive grouping for your whole system.

Every metapackage must have a ``CMakeLists.txt`` containing these
commands::

  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
  project(PACKAGE_NAME)
  find_package(catkin REQUIRED)
  catkin_metapackage()

Because the metapackage ``CMakeLists.txt`` contains a catkin macro,
its ``package.xml`` must declare a buildtool dependency on catkin::

  <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>

Additional buildtool, build or test dependencies are not permitted.

Metapackages list all packages or other metapackages in their group
using ``<run_depend>`` tags::

  <run_depend>your_custom_msgs</run_depend>
  <run_depend>your_server_node</run_depend>
  <run_depend>your_utils</run_depend>


Compatibility
=============

Modification to previous specifications
---------------------------------------

 * Authors are now split into authors and maintainers.

  - Multiple people and their emails are specified in separate tags
    and attributes.
  - Authors are now optional.
  - Maintainers must provide an email address.
  - At least one maintainer is now required.

 * Multiple licenses can now be used, even though a single license per
   package is desired.

 * Multiple ``url`` tags can be specified with ``type`` attributes
   indicating their meanings.

 * The former ``depend`` and ``rosdep`` have been unified, but also
   split into various types of dependencies.

 * The ``export`` tag:

  - The ``cpp`` tag has been dropped, it is handled by catkin.
  - The ``roslang`` tag has been dropped, it is handled by catkin.

 * The ``copyright`` tag has been dropped.
 * The ``logo`` tag has been dropped.
 * The ``review`` tag has been dropped, that information will be
   stored on the website of that package.
 * The ``versioncontrol`` tag has been dropped.

Backward compatibility
----------------------

All tools using ``stack.xml`` and ``manifest.xml`` are updated to work
with ``package.xml`` files.

Migration to the new format only affects packages being converted to
catkin.  Existing rosbuild packages remain the same.  Rosdep
distinguishes between catkin and rosbuild and returns the correct
system dependencies.

Affected tools
--------------

List of tools affected by the specification (which is very like not
complete):

 * bloom
 * buildfarm
 * catkin
 * roscd
 * rosdep
 * rosdoc
 * roslaunch
 * roslib
 * rospack
 * rospkg
 * rosrun
 * rosstack

Several tools are affected by the transition from packaging packages
instead of stacks and not really by the specification of the format
for the package information.

Future enhancements
-------------------

Additional meta-information can be added within the ``export`` tag, as
needed.

New features related to the infrastructure can be specified and
integrated using additional tags and attributes, but this requires
introducing a new ``<package>`` format number.
