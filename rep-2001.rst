Abstract
========

This REP describes the variants for the ROS Bouncy release and for releases that follow until otherwise replaced by a similar update REP.


Motivation
==========

For a discussion on the general motivation and role of variants,
please see REP 108 [1]_.

This document covers the common variants used for recommended
installations.
It is expressed in the ros2/variants repository on github.com [2]_.

The definitions in this REP are concise for clearer purpose, and do not list all transitive dependencies explicitly.


Specification
=============

End-user entry points
---------------------

We define three main entry points for ROS users.

 * desktop (recommended)
 * ros_base
 * ros_core

Variants
--------

ROS Core
''''''''

The `ros_core` variants composes the core communication protocols.
It may not contain any GUI dependencies.

::

 - ros_core:
      packages: [ament_cmake, ament_cmake_ros, ament_index, ament_lint,
                 ament_package, class_loader, common_interfaces,
                 console_bridge, googletest, launch, libyaml_vendor,
                 osrf_pycommon, osrf_testing_tools_cpp, pluginlib,
                 poco_vendor, rcl, rcl_interfaces, rclcpp, rclpy,
                 rcutils, rmw, rmw_implementation, ros2cli, rosidl,
                 rosidl_dds, rosidl_defaults, rosidl_python, rosidl_typesupport,
                 ros_environment, sros2, tinyxml2_vendor, uncrustify]
      And at least one of the following rmw_implementation:
      - Fast-RTPS: [Fast-CDR, Fast-RTPS, rmw_fastrtps]
      - Connext: [rmw_connext, rosidl_typesupport_connext]
      - Opensplice: [rmw_opensplice, rosidl_typesupport_opensplice]


ROS Base
''''''''

The `ros_base` metapackage composes the `ros_core` metapackage with
commonly used libraries.
It may not contain any GUI dependencies.

::

  - ros_base:
      extends: [ros_core]
      packages: [geometry2, kdl_parser, orocos_kinematics_dynamics,
                 robot_state_publisher, tinyxml_vendor, urdf, urdfdom,
                 urdfdom_headers]


Desktop variants
''''''''''''''''

The `desktop` metapackage is the main entry point for users.
It provides all commonly used libraries as well as visualization tools and tutorials.

::

  - desktop:
      extends: [ros_base]
      packages: [angles, demos, depthimage_to_laserscan, example_interfaces,
                 examples, joystick_drivers, laser_geometry,
                 navigation_msgs, pcl_conversions, realtime_support,
                 resource_retriever, rviz, teleop_twist_joy,
                 teleop_twist_keyboard, tlsf, turtlesim, vision_opencv]


Institution-specific and robot-specific
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Please see REP 108 [1]_ for discussion of institution-specific
metapackages.

When creating robot or institution specific metapackages consider
using the \*_robot and \*_desktop and \*_base form where * is the
institution or robot name.

An institution is not required to provide a metapackage, they are
mainly provided for convenience and identity.
