Abstract
========

This REP describes a new ROS directory hierarchy for installed files
based on the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) [1]_.  It discusses
the implications of those changes, and their effects on ROS code being
converted to that standard.

To allow installation of multiple ROS distributions on a single
machine, this layout is normally created within a
distribution-specific install prefix. But, this specification supports
installs within ``/usr``, as well.

This REP has evolved since the original Fuerte draft.  The "`Fuerte
Differences`_" section explains differences between that preliminary
implementation and the current specification.

The majority of this specification is due to the hard work of Troy
Straszheim and Morten Kjaergaard on the catkin build system, which is
the reference implementation on which this REP is based.  This REP
does not document catkin itself and is intended to be
implementation-neutral.


Specification
=============

This specification defines changes to the filesystem layout,
associated environment variable updates, and necessary modifications
to ROS itself.

This document mostly avoids details of the catkin build system [10]_.


Filesystem layout
'''''''''''''''''

Install prefix
--------------

For clarity, the install prefix is referred to as
``/opt/ros/<distro>``. The install prefix does not have to follow this
exact pattern, but it is the convention for ROS binary distributions.

This layout is also intended to enable installations within the
standard ``/usr`` hierarchy.

Directory layout
----------------

The layout within the install prefix is::

    bin/
    etc/
    include/
    lib/
    share/
    stacks/


This generally follows FHS conventions, with the addition of the
``stacks`` directory for backwards compatibility with rosmake
packages.  The install also contains setup files to easily configure
environment variables for this prefix.

These subdirectories are described in greater detail below.


bin/
----

``bin`` is used to store top-level executables, i.e. executables that
should be included in every ROS user's ``PATH``.  This replaces the
old ``ROS_ROOT/bin`` location that stored core ROS binaries, like
``rostopic`` and ``rospack``.

ROS packages that are converted to use this new layout may install
into ``bin``, but should do so sparingly as it is included in the
user's ``PATH``.  Developers should also beware of name collisions in
thise executables.  In general, try to name executables so that their
origin is obvious, perhaps using the ROS package name.

In the case of a special install prefix, ``PATH`` must include this
location, e.g.::

    PATH=/opt/ros/<distro>/bin:$PATH

etc/
----

This location is used to install global configuration files for a
particular ROS distribution.  Within the context of ROS, we introduce
``etc/ros``, where ROS-specific system configuration files are stored.

Additionally, there is an ``etc/catkin`` and ``etc/langs`` that are
used by the catkin build system.  Although ``etc/langs`` configures
the active ROS message generators, its implementation is specific to
message generation using catkin, not specified here.


include/
--------

ROS packages using the new install layout must install all header
files to the ``include`` directory.  Assuming a ROS package uses the
namespace ``<ros-package-name>``, its include files are stored in::

    include/<ros-package-name>/

The specific include directories for a package are located using
``pkg-config`` or CMake ``find_package()``.


lib/
----

ROS packages using the new install layout must install library files
to the ``lib`` directory.

Python modules are installed to ``lib/pythonX.Y``, where ``X.Y`` is
the Python version.  This directory follows the standard Python
specification for the target platform, which may be
``lib/pythonX.Y/dist-packages``, or ``lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages``,
or somewhere else.

In the case of a special install prefix, ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` must
enable locating libraries and include directories via ``pkg-config``.
``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` must be also set so that executables can load
shared libraries.  We use the settings::

    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/ros/<distro>/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/ros/<distro>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

``PYTHONPATH`` must also be set in a special install prefix and is
platform dependent.  For example, on Ubuntu Precise with Python 2.7, the
setting is::

    PYTHONPATH=/opt/ros/<distro>/python2.7/dist-packages:$PYTHONPATH


lib/<ros-package-name>/
-----------------------

All package-relative executables and scripts are installed in
``lib/<ros-package-name>/`` subdirectory.


share/
------

All architecture-independent package-relative assets are explicitly
installed to ``share/<ros-package-name>``.  These include:

- package definition files (``package.xml``)
- launch files
- other explicitly installed package-relative data such as bag files,
  or parameter definitions


stacks/
-------

This is the installation location for rosmake-based stacks.  It is
included in the ``ROS_PACKAGE_PATH``, but has lower precedence than
packages following the new REP 122 layout.  Converted packages do not
use this folder.


Environment variables
'''''''''''''''''''''

``ROS_ROOT``
------------

For backwards compatibility with rosmake build files, ``ROS_ROOT``
must exist within the new layout. However, its scope has been narrowed
to finding legacy ``rosbuild`` and ``mk`` resources. Other uses, such
as finding ROS binaries, are no longer supported.  Thus, ``ROS_ROOT``
is deprecated.  Although there are no plans to remove it, avoid using
it for any new features.

For a full specification and rationale, see REP 123 [9]_, which also
proposes new ROS filesystem environment variables based on the REP 122
layout.


Changes to ROS
''''''''''''''

PYTHONPATH, roslib.load_manifest()
----------------------------------

Python modules now install into a ``dist-packages``/``site-packages``
in the ``lib`` directory in the install prefix.  This installation
uses the standard Python distutil/setuptools toolchain.

The Python install directory is added to the ``PYTHONPATH``.  Thus,
these modules are immediately accessible via Python ``import`` and do
not require a ``roslib.load_manifest()``.

In order to prevent unnecessary accumulation to the Python
``sys.path``, ``roslib.load_manifest()`` does not recurse through
packages built with catkin.

Python modules and scripts that are part of the FHS install layout
*must not* use ``load_manifest`` as it does not work properly within
an out-of-source build.

Motivation
==========

The ROS Groovy release migrates many low-level libraries to use a
standard Filesystem Hiearchy Standard-like layout [2]_ contained in a
ROS-distribution-specific install prefix
(e.g. ``/opt/ros/groovy/``). The goals of this conversion are many:

- Make ROS libraries more "normal"

- Enable the ROS toolchain to use existing libraries for packaging
  and release (e.g. ``git-buildpackage``)

- Enable ROS messages, libraries and tools to be easily integrated
  with other build systems via ``pkg-config`` and CMake's
  ``find_package()``.

- Enable ROS binary releases to be accepted into Debian, Ubuntu, and
  other Linux distributions.
   
- Preserve the ability to install multiple ROS distributions on the
  same machine.

- Eventually eliminate the need for ROS-specific filesystem
  environment variables if the installation is to a standard prefix,
  such as ``/usr``.


The final goal should be possible with converted stacks, but has not
yet been verified.  The main focus has been on preserving the ability
to install multiple ROS distributions on the same machine, as robots
frequently are shared, expensive resources.

Compatibility with the Filesystem Hiearchy Standard has been a
long-term goal for ROS.  ROS began as an in-source, package-relative
system for finding, developing, building, and distributing code.
Multiple attempts have been made to transition towards an
FHS-compatible layout for ROS, including the withdrawn REP 102 [5]_
and a prototype "rosbuild2" system that was deployed in ROS Electric.
Experiences with those previous efforts have enabled us to accomplish
this goal with minimal compatibility issues.

One major goal these changes have enabled is much better integration
with external libraries, such as PCL.  The standalone version of PCL
1.x can now build against the required ROS messages using CMake,
although with significant modifications.  The intent is for ROS to use
the standalone PCL 2.0 libraries without modification.  Hopefully,
many more libraries will be able to transition to standalone
implementations.


Rationale
=========

The rationale for using the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard is simple:
it makes ROS releases conform to generally-accepted open source
practice.  Most of this REP describes straightforward translations to
that standard.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

/opt/ros/<distro>/stacks
''''''''''''''''''''''''

There are no known regressions related to the new layout for building
rosmake stacks that are specific to this specification.  We have been
able to build legacy stacks on top of the REP 122-compliant stacks by
using the ROS manifest "export" mechanism with the output of
``pkg-config``.  No changes were necessary to the rosmake toolchain
based on this REP.  Legacy stacks still use the same installation
procedure as before.

We have put together a migration guide [6]_ that generally notes
issues with increased link/include strictness that are separate from
this REP.

rosmake
'''''''

rosmake will recurse into packages that are installed in ``share``.
As this location does not contain ``Makefile`` files, it will treat
this as not buildable.

roslaunch remote, <machine> tag incompatibility
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The changes in this specification break compatibility with roslaunch
remote launches as the environment configuration is very different.
The non-backwards-compatible changes required in roslaunch are
specified separately in REP 124 [7]_.

ROS_ROOT
''''''''

As described above, ``ROS_ROOT`` preserves backwards-compatibility for
``mk`` and ``rosbuild`` files.  For example,::

    include($ENV{ROS_ROOT}/core/rosbuild/rosbuild.cmake)

resolves to the same path.

roslib.load_manifest()
''''''''''''''''''''''

The Python environment bootstrapper, ``roslib.load_manifest()``, is
safe to use in rosmake-based packages.  However, it is not necessary
for importing Python modules that use the FHS install layout.

As noted above, ``roslib.load_manifest()`` should not be used in
converted packages.


rosinstall
''''''''''

Changes to both ``ROS_ROOT`` and environment setup have created
incompatibilities with the rosinstall tool.  There are also separate
issues with rosinstall and catkin compatibility when building
completely from source that are separate from the issues of install
layout changes.  These are resolvable and are handled by the affected
scripts.


Package contents
''''''''''''''''

The ``share/`` does not preserve the full contents of ROS packages
within the installed layout.  This affects package-relative workflows,
like using``rosed`` to quickly view header file information.  There
are two categories of contents no longer locatable by package-relative
tools:

 1. Resources that are installed in a different location (e.g. C++
    header files in ``include``)
 2. Sources resources (e.g. C++ ``.cpp files``) that are no longer
    installed due to explicit installation targets.


roscreate-stack
'''''''''''''''

With Groovy, stacks and packages no longer have the same container
relationship as before.  It is no longer possible to determine the
packages that a stack contains in the install layout.  So, the
``share/`` layout does not preserve any stack-package relationship.

The tool most directly affected is ``roscreate-stack``.  Although
convenient, it has little utility moving forward, so we made the
difficult decision to delete it.


Fuerte Differences
==================

A reference implementation was initially deployed in the ROS Fuerte
release.  There have been some changes since then, which will be
incorporated in the ROS Groovy release.

This section notes differences between the Fuerte implementation and
the current specification.

buildspace
''''''''''

In Fuerte the FHS layout was only applied during the installation
step.  The build folder was not a supported environment to run the
compiled binaries and generated code.  While some simple applications
worked features like i.e. discovering plugins were not supported in
the build folder.  Therefore the ``make install`` step was always
necessary before developers could run their modified code.  This made
it less convenient and increased the round-trip time during
development substantially.

In Groovy the build folder contains a subdirectory ``buildspace``
which resembles the same structure than an installation.  The content
of that folder also follows FHS conventions.  It enables to run any
application from buildspace as well as if it would be installed.


catkin tag in manifest
''''''''''''''''''''''

Fuerte package manifests [3]_ temporary had a ``<catkin/>`` tag to
indicate that they are built using the catkin build system.  That tag
was a performance optimization for tools like ``rosmake`` and the
Python ``roslib.load_manifest()`` API.  It was not required, but was
recommended.

For compatibility with newer versions of rospkg (released for Groovy)
the ``<catkin/>`` tag must be removed from Fuerte manifests.

Catkin packages in Groovy replace the traditional ``manifest.xml``
with a newly-defined ``package.xml``, defined in REP 127 [11]_.


share/
''''''

ROS Fuerte used ``share`` to install all ROS manifest and
package-relative resources.  That included package-relative binaries,
which is contrary to normal FHS standards as ``share/`` is intended
for "read-only architecture independent data files" [8]_.

As documented above, some archtecture-independent files (like launch
and parameter files) are still installed to
``share/<ros-package-name>/``.  But, some that landed there in Fuerte
are now omitted or stored somewhere else:

- ``manifest.xml`` is no longer used
- ``stack.xml`` is no longer used
- package-relative-executables (both binary and script) moved to
  ``lib/<ros-package-name>/`` instead.
