Abstract
========

This REP defines a new "source" package manager for rosdep [1]_ that
improves source-based installation of system dependencies.  The new
source package manager provides scripts for installing dependencies
and verifying that they are present.  This REP builds on the new
rosdep syntax introduced in REP 111 [2]_.

Motivation
==========

The motivation for this REP is similar to REP 111 [2]_.  To quote from REP 111:

    ... the bash script specification was brittle and provided
    limited information to rosdep itself.  The scripts were required to
    be idempotent because rosdep was unable to detect whether or not the
    dependency was already installed. 

    The goal of this REP is to make rosdep more robust and flexible, as
    well as enable better support of platforms other than Ubuntu.


This REP specifically introduces a custom rosdep package manager that
provides a new mechanism for source-based installations of software
libraries.  The goals for this new package manager are:

 * Reliable, source-based installation of thirdparty libraries for any ROS platform.
 * Enable rosdep to check that source-based dependencies are present.
 * Allow source rosdeps to have prerequisites, i.e. to depend on other rosdeps.
 * Enable any community member to contribute rosdep-compatible packaging for libraries.
 * Enable automated verification of source-based dependencies without superuser access.
 * Reduce duplication in rosdep source installation rules.


There are several anticipated use cases for this new source-based
package manager.  The first is to provide generic scripts for
POSIX-based systems for common thirdparty libraries.  These generally
can be improved by integrating the native package manager for that
platform, but the source mechanism provides an initial working system.

A new, anticipated use case is improving support for ROS on platforms
that lack official package managers.  For example, support for ROS on
Windows is improving and will soon require better infrastructure for
satisfying rosdep dependencies.  Similarly, although OS X users can
use MacPorts for rosdep dependencies, this REP provides an alternative
mechanism that is more stable and easier to lock to specific OS X
versions.


Specification
=============

rosdep.yaml additions
---------------------

rosdep.yaml syntax: source PACKAGE_MANAGER, fields
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

According to REP 111 [2]_, the basic syntax for a rosdep.yaml rule is:

::

        ROSDEP_NAME:
          OS_NAME1: 
            PACKAGE_MANAGER1:
              PACKAGE_ARGUMENTS_A
          OS_NAME2: 
            PACKAGE_MANAGER2:
              PACKAGE_ARGUMENTS_A


The source package manager defines the ``PACKAGE_MANAGER`` and ``PACKAGE_ARGUMENTS``
fields as follows:

 * ``PACKAGE_MANAGER`` is ``source``
 * ``PACKAGE_ARGUMENTS``: the ``source`` package manager accepts a dictionary with three possible keys:

   - ``uri`` (string): the primary download uri for the rosdep manifest (*required*).
   - ``alternate-uri`` (string):  a mirror download uri for the rosdep manifest (*optional*).  
   - ``md5sum`` (string): md5sum hash of the rdmanifest for security and verification. (*optional, recommended*)

As defined by REP 111, the use of the ``source`` package manager is
specific to a OS platform.

The use of the ``md5sum`` field is *strongly recommended*.  It
provides protection against thirdparty library installs being
compromised either due to corruption or malicious intent.  It also
enables the downloaded file to be verified for completeness.

rosdep.yaml example source rule:
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The following example is a plausible rosdep.yaml rule for installing
the yaml-cpp library on an Ubuntu system.  This rule references an
external rosdep manifest file, as well as an mirror of this
installation for additional robustness.

::

    yaml-cpp:
      ubuntu:
        source:
          uri: 'https://kforge.ros.org/rosrelease/viewvc/sourcedeps/yaml-cpp/yaml-cpp-0.2.5.rdmanifest'
          alternate-uri: 'https://mirror-kforge.ros.org/rosrelease/viewvc/sourcedeps/yaml-cpp/yaml-cpp-0.2.5.rdmanifest'
          md5sum: 740a2193cea112f5ef682d9f69f9c7b1


rosdep manifests (``.rdmanifest``)
----------------------------------

The ``rosdep.yaml`` rule for the source package manager points to an
external rosdep manifest (``.rdmanifest``) file that provides the
necessary URLs and scripts for managing a system dependency.

There may one or more than one ``.rdmanifest`` file for a given
software package dependencing on the installation and platforms needs
of the software.  For example, a single ``.rdmanifest`` file may be
sufficient for POSIX-based systems, but a separate ``.rdmanifest`` may
be necessary for OS X systems.  This choice is not enforced by this
REP and is up to the developer providing the integration.

``.rdmanifest`` syntax
''''''''''''''''''''''

The rosdep manifest (``.rdmanifest``) file has 6 fields:

 * ``uri`` (string): The uri of the tarball to download.  

 * ``md5sum`` (string): The expected md5sum of the tarball (*recommended*)

 * ``alternate-uri`` (string): An optional alternate-uri for reliability
   (recommended)

 * ``check-presence-script`` (multi-line string): a script that exits
   with return code zero if a package is already present, non-zero otherwise.  This
   script is downloaded to a temporary file and executed with the user's account.  

 * ``install-script`` (multi-line string): a script that installs
   software library from tarball.  The script is downloaded to a
   temporary file and executed with the user's account.  The working
   directory set to the ``exec-path``, which is generally the
   directory where the unpacked tarball is located.

 * ``exec-path`` (string): relative path used to specify working directory of
   the ``install-script`` (*optional*).  The path is interpreted to be
   relative to the directory the tarball is downloaded and unpacked
   to. ``exec-path`` is optional and defaults to '.', i.e. the directory
   of the tarball.

 * ``depends`` (string list): list of rosdep dependencies that must
   be installed before checking or installing this rosdep.

check-presence-script and install-script
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The ``check-presence-script`` and ``install-script`` are text-based
scripts that are downloaded and executed by rosdep.  rosdep will
assign these scripts an executable permission and they may be written
in any executable text format supported by the target platform.

For example, on POSIX-based systems, scripts can use a shebang to
specify the desired interpreter of the script, such as ``#!/bin/sh``
or ``#!/usr/bin/env python``.  

The scripts are executed using the user's account.  In the event that
a script requires superuser access, it must explicitly invokes
commands like ``sudo`` on its own.  It is *strongly recommended* that
the ``check-presence-script`` not use any superuser privileges as this
interferes with automated verification of dependencies.  This
recommendation is only for the ``check-presence-script`` as it is
expected that an ``install-script`` will need to use superuser
permissions for final install steps, e.g. ``make install``.

Source package manager implementation
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In the event that rosdep determines that the source package manager is
responsible for a rosdep dependency, the following steps are taken by
the source package manager to verify a system dependency is installed.

 1. Download the ``.rdmanifset`` file referenced by the ``uri`` rule.  If the primary ``uri`` is unavailable, attempt to download the ``alternate-uri``. 
 2. If md5sum is specified, validate the md5sum of the  ``.rdmanifest`` file.
 3. Verify that all rosdep dependencies specified in ``depends`` in the ``.rdmanifest`` are installed.
 4. Download the ``check-presence-script`` specified in the ``.rdmanifest`` file.
 5. Execute the ``check-presence-script`` with the current user's account.

If the script returns zero, the installation is assumed to be present.
Otherwise, rosdep may determine that it is necessary to perform an
installation of this dependency.  If the source package manager is
asked to install a dependency, the following steps are followed:

 1. Download the tarball specified in the ``uri`` rule.  If the primary ``uri`` is unavailable, attempt to download the ``alternate-uri``.
 2. If md5sum is specified, validate the md5sum of the tarball.
 3. Unpack the tarball.
 4. Download the ``install-script`` specified in the ``.rdmanifest`` file. The working directory of the ``install-script`` specified by ``exec-path``, which defaults to the directory the tarball is unpacked to.
 5. Execute the ``install-script`` with the current user's account.


``.rdmanifest`` example
'''''''''''''''''''''''

The following example demonstrates a plausible rosdep manifest file
for the yaml-cpp library.  This particular rosdep manifest file
leverages the ``dpkg`` tool and thus will only work on Debian-based
systems. A more generic rosdep manifest file could be written to work
on a greater variety of platforms, or different rosdep manifest files
could be written to support other platforms.

::

    uri: 'https://kforge.ros.org/rosrelease/viewvc/sourcedeps/yaml-cpp/yaml-cpp-0.2.5.tar.gz'
    md5sum: b17dc36055cd2259c88b2602601415d9
    install-script: |
      #!/bin/bash
      set -o errexit
      mkdir -p build
      cd build
      cmake ..
      make
      echo "About to run checkinstall make install"
      sudo checkinstall -y --nodoc --pkgname=yaml-cpp-sourcedep make install
    check-presence-script: |
      #!/bin/bash
      dpkg-query -W -f='${Package} ${Status}\n' yaml-cpp-sourcedep | awk '{\
      if ($4 =="installed")
        exit 0
      else
        print "yaml-cpp-sourcedep not installed"
        exit 1}'
    exec-path: yaml-cpp-0.2.5
    depends: [checkinstall ]

Rationale
=========

depends
-------

The rosdep manifest file follows the recommendation of REP 111 and
provides a dependency specification.  The ``depends`` syntax in the
rosdep manifest provides greater flexibility when integrating software
packages.  It functions similar to `dpkg` and `rpm` dependencies,
where it provides an ordering for installing a hierarchical set of
libraries.  It also enables developers to use multiple package
managers to satisfy dependencies.  For example, the library could
specify dependencies that resolve to ``apt`` or ``yum`` installations,
and then perform a source-based install on top.


rosdep manifest files
---------------------

The new rosdep manifest files provides for a separation of roles when
integrating libraries into rosdep: those that provide wrappers for
thirdparty libraries to be used in ROS, and those that integrate these
into ``rosdep.yaml`` files in a ROS stack hierarchy.  Authors of
thirdparty libraries can provide integration with rosdep without
having to release separate ROS stacks.

This approach does comes with some disadvantages. In the previous
implementation of source-based installs for rosdep, the entire
installation script was contained within the ``rosdep.yaml`` rule.
This enabled the ``rosdep.yaml`` file to be complete: no additional
specifications were necessary, other than implicit resources
referenced by the script.  REP 111 instead requires developers to also
to create and host a separate rosdep manifest file.

Although this separation has additional overhead, it has benefits
beyond the separation of roles described above.  First, the inline
syntax leads to more duplication.  Two platforms wishing to both used
a source-based install must repeat the entire rule separately, even if
the rules are identical.

The old inline approach also led to repetition in cases where two ROS
stacks, without a common ancestor, wished to integrate the same rosdep
library.  As these stacks do not have a common ancestor, each stack
must add the rosdep library in its own ``rosdep.yaml`` file.  This REP
reduces the duplication as each ``rosdep.yaml`` file only needs to
point at the external rosdep manifest file.

Finally, the inline syntax of the old rosdep format decreased the
readability of the ``rosdep.yaml`` files. which is an important
concern when maintaining these files over time.
