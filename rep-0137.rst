Abstract
========
This REP specifies a set of files which define ROS distributions and
facilitate the build and packaging process. The intention is to formalize the
existing infrastructure and simplify hosting of (potentially customized) ROS
buildfarms.

Motivation
==========
A ROS distribution consists of numerous software packages maintained by various
contributors forming a coherent set. Until now there was
only one buildfarm responsible for running unit tests and generating Debian
packages for various Ubuntu versions and no formal description of the semantics
of the files used in that process was given so far. Expanding the
current capabilities to support other platforms and architectures will be
important extensions.

This REP aims to specify all information and file formats necessary to release
and package ROS distributions for various platforms and architectures. By
formalizing these data structures it should be enabled to:

* release packages using bloom [1]_ for all targeted platforms
* run unit tests for packages on selected platforms and architectures
* build binary packages for selected platforms and architectures

The use cases this REP is designed to address are:

1. simplify the setup of a buildfarm which builds and tests a ROS distribution,
   i.e. building and testing individual ROS distributions on separate buildfarms
2. enable building binary packages for (experimental) platforms and
   architectures
3. enable building binary packages of custom packages on top of the existing ROS
   distributions for publicly or privately hosted projects

Design requirements
===================
The information formalized in this REP is used in four separate processes:

* releasing a package
  This is the process of exporting upstream source and generating platform
  specific build files specific meta-information)
* running automated tests
* running documentation jobs
* building binary packages for a specific platform and architecture

There should be a single configuration which contains (or references) all
information required to run the above processes.
The configuration must be easily readable and editable by both humans as well
as machines and be extendable with future functionality.

The set of packages for which to build binary packages must be configurable
for each platform and architecture.

The release process should stay independent of the build process. The testing
can be performed on either the upstream source or on the released tarball
(depending on if the upstream source contains enough information to run the
test suite). The build process can only work on released packages.

Each configuration file must contain a label which identifies the semantics
of the file as well as a version number to enable future format updates.

Rationale
=========
A single configuration containing or referencing all required information
allows for a single entry point for automated processing in the above
mentioned processes.

Specifying individual subsets of packages per platform and architecture is
necessary since not all released packages can and should be build on all
platforms and architectures.

The information for the various processes should be separated from each other
to ease customizing individual processes. This is especially necessary since
different processes will be run by separate entities.

Specification
=============

This REP intends to give a formal specification for some files that are already
in use:
* current distribution files (groovy.yaml)
* targets.yaml

The changes to the distribution file are minimal, such as adding type and
version fields, and can be performed by a script.

The targets.yaml file will be split and merged in the distribution files.

File format
-----------

Files use YAML 1.1 for the sake of human and machine readability and
write-ability.
As a good practice, the should contain a header such as:

::

  %YAML 1.1
  # distribution file
  # this file describes a ROS distribution.
  # see REP 137: http://ros.org/reps/rep-0137.html
  ---



Master file
-----------
The master file act as a single configuration entrypoint which lists all
available ROS distributions, along with references pointing to further process
specific information.
The references can be either relative to the master file or absolute.

The information stored in the master file is:

* distributions: a list of ROS distributions

  For each distribution further information are referenced:

  * release: reference to the release distribution file
  * release_build: list of references to the build files used to build the binary packages
  * test: reference to the distribution file used for tests
  * test_build: list of references to the build file used to run the tests
  * doc_folder: a reference to the documentation folder. The full specification of this folder
    does not belong to the scope of this REP and is considered an implementation
    detail.  In the future it might utilize a similar infrastructure to release and test files. 
  * distribution_cache: reference to a distribution cache. Whether this field is
    a dictionary, a list or a scalar is left as an implementation detail. The
    following examples will assume that the implementation necessitates an url.

* type: must be 'master'
* version: version number, this REP describes version 1

Example
-------
A master file referencing multiple distribution and build files.

::

  %YAML 1.1
  # master file
  # this file describes the available ROS distributions.
  # see REP 137: http://ros.org/reps/rep-0137.html
  ---
  distributions:
    groovy:
      release: releases/groovy.yaml
      release_build: [releases/groovy-build-ubuntu.yaml, releases/groovy-build-arm.yaml]
      test: tests/groovy.yaml
      test_build: [tests/groovy-build.yaml]
      doc_folder: doc/groovy
      distribution_cache: http://www.example.com/groovy-distribution-cache
    hydro:
      ...
  type: master
  version: 1

Distribution file
-----------------
A distribution is identified by the code name of the ROS distribution.
Each distribution contains the following:

* repositories: a list of repositories which are identified by unique names

  * url: the URL of the release git repository
    The URL should be writable (with the appropriate credentials).
  * version: version number for which packages are released. This
    can be a tag, branch or hash.
  * status: defines the status of the packages of the repository. Can be one of
    the following: ``developed``, ``maintained``, ``unmaintained``,
    ``end-of-life``
  * status_description: an optional field describing in a short sentence the
    current status of the repository.  For example detailing the reason
    for EOL and the recommended upgrade path.
  * packages: an optional list of packages.  If no package is specified, 
    one package with the name of the repository is assumed in the root of the repository.
    Each package is a dictionary with the following optional keys:

    * subfolder: the relative path to the package from the repository base
      (default: *package name*)
    * status: overrides the repository-wide status
    * status_description: overrides the repository-wide status description
  * tags: a dict of tags which can be used by tools like bloom and
    the rosinstall generator, preventing the need for those tools to guessing about tags in
    release repositories, e.g. 'release/package/1.2.3' vs 'release/groovy/package/1.2.3-4'.
    This provides a useful future proofing mechanism for tools which use tags in the
    release repository, rather than guessing the format of the tags they can infer them
    directly from the tag templates.

    * *tag_name {release, debian, etc...}*: Format of tags are strings with {template_variables}
      e.g. 'release/groovy/{package}/{version}' A non-exhaustive list of possible template tags:

      * package - name of the package which this release tag corresponds
      * version - full version of the package being released, e.g. 1.2.3-4
      * upstream_version - upstream version of package being released, e.g. 1.2.3
      * debian_distro - target debian distro codename
      * debian_package_name - name of package, with any prefix and sanitized for debian

      The only required tag_name is 'release', others like 'debian' are optional.

* platforms: a list of target platforms for which packages are released.
  Each entry of this list is a key-value pair, with the OS name as a key and
  the list of version code names as a value.
  These names are OS code names as determined by *rospkg.os_detect* [4]_.
  Each target platform will result in a different bloom release.

* type: must be 'distribution'
* version: version number, this REP describes version 1

**Example**: A distribution file listing repositories and packages and the
target platforms.

Build file
----------
* package_whitelist: a list of packages to build.
  If this is omitted all packages specified in the distribution file are build.
  Any upstream packages are implicitly included.
* package_blacklist: a list of packages excluded from build.
  If this is omitted no packages are excluded.
  Any downstream package are implicitly excluded.
  The blacklist overrides the whitelist.

* notifications: An optional section to configure email notifications.  

  * emails: a list of emails to which to send all emails. (default: empty) 
  * maintainers: a boolean flag used to enable email notification to listed maintainers. (default: false) 
  * committers: a boolean flag used to enable email notification to committers. (default: false)

* targets: a list of targets for which packages are build.
  Each target consists of a platform (OS code name) and CPU architecture.
  Code names specified in the list must be listed in the corresponding
  distribution file.
* jenkins_url: the url to the associated jenkins build farm
* apt_mirrors: a list of urls to apt repositories used for pulling build dependencies.
  Defaults to a list containing only the repository defined in apt_target_repository
* apt_target_repository: url of the apt repository used for pushing built packages.
  Note: this option is only used for release builds, and will be ignored in other cases.
* sync: specify the criteria that need to be fulfilled for packages to be synced with the
  apt repo. Any of the following options can be set:

  * package_count: integer. Specifies how many packages need to be successfully built to
    initiate sync. (default: 0)
  * packages: list of package names. All the packages of this list must be successfully built to
    initiate sync. (default: [])

  Note: this option is only used for release builds, and will be ignored in other cases.
* type: must be 'build'
* version: version number, this REP describes version 1

**Example**: A build file selecting a subset of packages from the distribution
and specifying the platforms and architectures.

    emails: [buildfarm-admin@example.com]
    maintainers: true
    committers: false

  apt_mirrors: [http://archives.example.com/ros, http://packages.foo.org/repos/example]
  sync:
    packages: [ros_tutorials]
  type: build
  version: 1

Test file
---------
The test file uses a specification similar to the distribution file, but does not
use a list of targets, and is not limited to git repositories.
The test file references either source repositories or release branches from
release repositories on which tests will be run.

* repositories: a list of repositories which are identified by unique names

  * type: the type of SCM in use. Typically 'git', 'svn'...
  * url: the URL of the release git repository
    The URL should be writable (with the appropriate credentials).
  * version: For git and hg this is the tag, branch or hash to be checked out.

* type: must be 'test'
* version: version number, this REP describes version 1

Documentation directory
-----------------------
The directory contains .rosinstall files which list repositories which should be used to generate API documentation.

Distribution cache file
-----------------------
Collection of all meta information of the ROS distribution, including all the information from the package.xml files.
The cache must reference the distribution file and store a hash of the version it was build from to be able to detect if the cache is invalid.
The format of that cache is considered an implementation detail and is not specified in this REP.

Reference implementation
------------------------
This REP is to be implemented in a Python module called *rosdistro*. This module
will serve as a reference implementation for this REP. Any ROS tool requesting
information defined in this REP should use this reference API implementation.

Compatibility issues
====================

To ensure a proper error message for older tools, the following
item is required in distribution files:

::

  gbp-repos: {You must update to a newer rosdep version by calling..sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python-rosdep (make sure to uninstall the pip version on Ubuntu):}

Affected tools
--------------

* bloom [1]_: bloom relies on rosdep to retrieve the list of targets. Changes to
  bloom are thought to be minimal (probably none)
* buildfarm: the buildfarm needs to know for which target/architecture it
  builds packages. It should use rosdistro for that purpose
* catkin-debs: actual tools use an internal rosdistro implementation that does
  not correspond to this REP
* reprepro-updater: needs a list of supported targets to generate repositories,
  should rely on rosdistro
* rosdep [2]_: rosdep also provides a list of targets (the old targets.yaml file),
  should rely on rosdistro
* rosdistro: this is the preferred implementation of the specifications listed
  in this REP. All other tools should use rosdistro
* roslocate [3]_: should be updated to use rosdistro
* rosdoc/rosdoc-lite: should be updated to use rosdistro


Use case examples
=================
Full distribution build
-----------------------
This corresponds to building a ROS distribution called *foo* for officially
supported platforms and architectures.
