Abstract
========
This REP defines and describes the set of ROS distribution files needed to
maintain consistency among a ROS distribution and facilitate the build process.
This is required by the Bloom release process, as well as the build process on a
Jenkins build farm.

Motivation
==========
ROS is distributed in the form of a software distribution that integrates
software written by various contributors into a coherent set of packages.
As such, the release and build systems need a reliable, centralized way to
gather information about these packages.
As ROS aspires to be a ubiquitous software platform for robotic applicarions,
the release and packaging systems must also be versatile and extendable as to
allow for a wide range of use cases. This REP primarily targets custom
buildfarms, and aims at providing the required infrastructure for this purpose.
Rosdistro release files have been used by different tools to provide a
centralized list of packages that a ROS distribution contains and maintains.
These files take the form of YAML files and are easily readable and editable.
However, no formal description of the syntax of these files was given so far.

The Rosdistro release files will serve several purposes:

 * describe each ROS distribution and provide all necessary information to
   reconstruct a whole distribution from scratch
 * provide build information to be used by automated build processes,
   independently of the build process being used
 * ease offline/experimental builds by using a simple file structure and easily
   editable files

Design requirements
===================
Different ROS core components utilize existing distribution files, for which no
formal specification was writtren. In order to minimize the potential
compatibility issues, changes to exsisting files and structures should not be
substantial.

Two different uses were identified for these files:
 * release process
 * build & distribution process

It should notably be understood that the release process is independant to the
build process, but that the build process cannot be independant to the release
process.

As a result, two sets of files are needed, and the build process needs to rely
on the release files to work.
The release files are used to define a ROS distribution, ie. a named list of
packages defining a specific, consistent API.
The set of release files should then be used by rosdistro to provide a
centralized way to access information related to a ROS distribution.

A build file that will serve as a configuration file to setup a buildfarm for a
specific use case is also required.

Proposition
===========
We propose to use a structure consisting in the following:

 * release:
    * master file
    * distribution files
 * build:
    * build.yaml


Rationale
=========
The release files are organized in a repository. A repository makes it easier
to keep all the information centralized, and gives flexibility to copy or
modify it.

YAML
----
We want to use the YAML file format for these files for two reasons:
 * it is easily readable and editable by both humans and machines
 * a YAML file can be extended with minimal impact on backward compatibility

In order to facilitate compatibility and extendability, the following rules
are proposed:
 * each file has a version number
 * each file has a type that links it to a specification
 * lists of elements, even in the form of dictionary entries, should be put
   under a named element of the file, ie. no top-level lists.

In addition to these design rules, and to the YAML syntax, and for the sake of
clarity and uniformity, we propose the following formatting rules:

 * indentation is two (2) spaces
 * items are listed in alphabetical order
 * lists of short words (eg. packages) are written using the inline form
   (square brackets)
 * no trailing spaces are allowed

Master file
-----------
This is the file containing a list of all the available ROS
distributions, along with links pointing to specific distribution files.
Paths are relative to the master file file.
The goal of this file is to have a practical way to fetch information about a
given ROS distribution, and to serve as a master directory of distributions
that a rosdistro repository contains. It should contain a list of distributions
with links to distribution files that actually contain all the information
related to it.

Distribution file
-----------------
Each yaml file referenced in the master file file is called a distribution
file. It contains a list of all the packages that are included in the ROS
software distribution along with their version and the release repository from
which they shall be fetched, as well as a list of supported target
architectures/linux distributions.

Build file
---------
This file is used by the buildfarm scripts (catkin-debs) to build ROS packages.
It contains a link to the rosdistros file and is not meant to be hosted in the
same place as the previous files.


Specification
=============
Master file
-----------

 * distros: list of released ROS distributions. Each distribution must have
   one of the following items:
    * devel: path to the devel distribution file
    * doc: path to the documentation folder
    * release: path to the release distribution file
 * type: must be 'rosdistros'
 * version: a version number, used to track file format changes

Example:

::

  distros:
    groovy:
      devel: releases/groovy-devel.yaml
      doc: doc/groovy
      release: releases/groovy.yaml
    hydro:
      devel: releases/hydro-devel.yaml
      doc: doc/hydro
      release: releases/hydro.yaml
  type: rosdistros
  version: 2.0


distibution file
----------------

 * release-name: the name of the ROS distribution to build
 * repositories: the contents of the distribution. A list of repositories that
   contain packages.
    * url: the git URL to to the repository base
    * version: the version of the repository
    * packages: an optional list of packages (if the repository has more than
      one)
 * targets: a list of target platforms for which to build
   This is currently a list of ubuntu/debian distributions, but will most likely
   be extended into a list of paltforms.
   Each platform can have different CPU architectures for which to build
 * type: must be 'distribution'
 * version: a version number, used to track file format changes

Example:

::

  release-name: groovy
  repositories:
    actionlib:
      url: git://github.com/ros-gbp/actionlib-release.git
      version: 1.9.11-0
    ar_track_alvar:
      url: https://github.com/ros-gbp/ar_track_alvar-release.git
      version: 0.3.0-0
    bond_core:
      url: git://github.com/ros-gbp/bond_core-release.git
      version: 1.7.10-0
      packages:
          bond:
          bond_core:
          bondcpp:
          bondpy:
          smclib:
  targets:
    oneiric: &pc ['amd64', 'i386']
    precise: ['amd64', 'i386', 'armel']
    quantal: *pc
    wheezy: ['armhf']
  type: distribution
  version: 1.0


build file
----------
 * type: must be 'build'
 * version: a version number, used to track file format changes

Example:

::

  build:
    from-distro:
      blacklist: [pr2-common]
    third-party: my-packages.yaml
  distribution: groovy
  notify-maintainers: no
  rosdistro-repo: http://raw.github.com/ros/rosdistro/master
  targets:
    whitelist:
      - distro: precise
    blacklist:
      - arch: armhf
      - arch: armel
  type: build
  version: 1.0
