Abstract
========

This REP specifies the coordinate frame conventions that should be applied to
marine robots used with ROS.

Rationale
=========

The maritime industry has standardized notation [1] that differs from the
conventions documented in REP 103 [2].
This REP extends REP 103 [2] and REP 105 [3] to include maritime notation in an
effort to improve interoperability across marine robotics projects that
implement either convention.

Specification
=============

Axis Orientation
----------------

In relation to a body, the maritime standard [1] is

* x forward
* y starboard
* z down

For short-range Cartesian representations of geographic locations, the maritime
standard [1] is:

* x north
* y east
* z down

Projects that implement the maritime standard [1] should comply with REP 103 [2]
by appending the suffix ``_fsd`` to the relevant body-fixed frames and the
suffix ``_ned`` to the relevant short-range Cartesian frames.

Coordinate Frames
-----------------

Marine robotics projects should default to the coordinate frame convention
documented in REP 105 [3].
For instances where the maritime standard [1] is needed, secondary suffix frames
should be defined.

Relationship between Frames
---------------------------

The relationship between the primary and secondary suffix frames yields the
following tree representation:

  <div class="mermaid" style="font-family:'Lucida Console', monospace">
  %% Example diagram
  graph LR
    O(odom) --> B(base_link)
    B --> BM(base_link_fsd)
    M(map) --> O
    O --> OM(odom_ned)
    E(earth) --> M
    M --> MM(map_ned)

  </div>

Compliance
==========

This REP depends on and is compliant with REP 103 [2] and REP 105 [3].
